# Vector Space Retrieval
An efficient Vector Space Model (VSM) implementation for retrieving medical data, built within the team project for the course [Information Retrieval and Web Search](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching/courses-for-master-candidates/ie663websearchandinformationretrieval/).
 
## Prerequisites
There are several tools you will need to install and execute the application. In the following is a list with all required tools and technologies required for installing and running the system:
 * _UNIX-like_ operating system: All development and testing was carried out on UNIX-like operating systems. On _Windows_ we encountered several compiler problems. Although fixed, we still strongly recommend to use a UNIX-like operating system (tested under _macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.4_, Arch Linux [Version..] and Ubuntu [Version...])
 * [CMake](https://cmake.org): We use CMake as platform independent build system. Before compiling several requirements will be checked by CMake and the compilation process will either fail or a warning will be emitted if requirements are not satisfied.
 * [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): As development and testing was carried out on UNIX-like operating systems, the de-facto standard build and install system _GNU Make_ is used internally by CMake.
 * [_C++17_ compatible compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org): As all tests were carried out with _GCC 7.3.0_, we recommend to use this one or a never version
 * [_boost_](https://www.boost.org): We use the popular C++ library _boost_ for several convenience functionalities such as efficiently splitting strings or dynamically creating bit vectors. If not already installed on your system, you will need to download the _Header-Only Library_ part of _boost_.
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): If you want to use the system with a web interface you will need to have _Node.js_ installed. The evsr-web part was tested under Node v10.1.0
 * Other libraries used in our project are the [Oleander Stemming Library](http://www.oleandersolutions.com/stemming/stemming.html) and a [C++ JSON Library](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/). The source code of these libraries is included in the `.zip`.
 
### System Requirements
The retrieval system stores a lot of index structures in-memory. Depending on the settings and execution mode, the system might need up to 2GB of main memory.

## Project Structure

### data
All data files required for the system are stored here. We used the medical dataset [nfcorpus](http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/nfcorpus/) from the Statistical NLP Group at the University of Heidelberg (a detailed description of the dataset can be found in [data/README.md](/data/README.md)). By default, the system will search here for the required data files. Optionally, you can provide your own file paths as command line argument (for more details see [Command Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments)). __Note__: For queries, it is not possible to provide a custom path for each query type but you can provide a path to the directory where all the query files are stored. It is __IMPORTANT__ to keep the same naming conventions otherwise the query files can not be found (The convention is: `q-[Query Type].queries`; Possible Query Types are `{'all', 'nontopictitles', 'titles', 'viddesc', 'vidtitles'}`). Also, in our setting, the query document file uses a `'~'` delimiter between the query ID and its content. The delimiter is hard coded into the system and must therefore match.

### docs
In this directory you can find the documentation of our source code. It was generated by using `doxygen`.

### evsr-web
In order to use the system from within a web interface, we implemented a small web server. For further informations read the instructions in this directory.

### python
Python scripts used for preprocessing and crawling the web.

### src
Directory of the C++ source code of the system and its libraries. For further information regarding the source code, take a look into the [Documentation](#docs) at docs.

### test
Directory of the unit tests.

## Getting Started
The build and installation process will be described in the following. Follow the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) for a fast installation and get the system running. This works only if the _boost_ library can be located in its default path. For a more detailed installation guide or if you encounter problems, take a look at [Detailed Installation Guide](#detailed-installation-guide).

### Quick Start Guide

1. Make sure all the [Requirements](#prerequisites) are satisfied

1. Clone the source with `git` (Can be omitted if you have a zipped version of the repository):
```
git clone https://github.com/WeberNick/vector-space-retrieval.git
```

3. Build and install:
```
cd vector-space-retrieval
./install.sh
```

4. Run
```
./bin/evsr_run       # Run the system
./bin/Unit_Tests_run # Run the unit tests
```

### Detailed Installation Guide

 * Make sure all the [Requirements](#prerequisites) are satisfied
 * Clone the source with `git` (Can be omitted if you have a zipped version of the repository):
```
git clone https://github.com/WeberNick/vector-space-retrieval.git
```

#### Set Up
 * To install and build the system, several additional options can be (and sometimes must be) provided to the installation process. A complete list of options is provided later.
 * If _boost_ is not located in the default search path (on Linux `/usr/include/boost`, `/usr/local/Cellar/boost` if installed using _homebrew_), you have to provide the absolute or relative path to the include directory of _boost_ via the `-b` option.
 * If _GCC_ is not the default compiler on your system (on macOS `g++` is often mapped to use `clang` instead) you may want to provide a path to the C++ compiler via the `-cxx` option (e.g., `/usr/bin/g++`)
```
cd vector-space-retrieval
./install.sh [-b [/path/to/boost/include]] [-cxx [/path/to/c++-compiler]] 
```

The `run.sh` script executes the binary with our recommended parameters (`--dimensions 5000 --tiers 100`), initializes logging for the project (`--trace`) and starts the evaluation mode. In addition it takes an optional parameter `-t`, which will cause the unit test to be executed. If you want to run the application with your own parameters please run the binary without the `run.sh` script:

```
./bin/evsr_run [your command line arguments]
```

##### Server mode 

Starting the application in server mode gives you the option to use a JSON formatted string to search. This mode is also used inside the `evsr-web` part. For example:

```
$ ./bib/evsr_run --server

[Initalization...]

[Ready]
{"query":"why does deep fried food may cause cancer? ","topK":10,"mode":"kVANILLA"}
[Your results]: ...

```

JSON format:

```json
{
  query: string,
  topK: number,
  mode: ModeType
}

//enum strings for mode
enum ModeType: {
  kVANILLA,
  kVANILLA_RAND,
  kVANILLA_W2V,
  kTIERED,
  kTIERED_RAND,
  kTIERED_W2V,
  kCLUSTER,
  kCLUSTER_RAND,
  kCLUSTER_W2
}
