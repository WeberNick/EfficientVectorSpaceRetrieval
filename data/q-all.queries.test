PLAIN-1~why deep fried foods may cause cancer in the latest study on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women , healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds . included in the unhealthy eating pattern was the consumption of deep-fried foods , which have previously been linked to breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , oral and throat cancers , esophageal cancer , and cancer of the voicebox . no deep fried foods ? what ’ s a southern belle to do ? instead of deep fried foods , how about the traditional southern diet , characterized by high intakes of cooked greens , beans , legumes , cabbage , sweet potatoes and cornbread , which may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer significantly . what about the consumption of deep-fried foods and risk of prostate cancer ? researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington found that eating french fries , fried chicken , fried fish , and doughnuts was associated with about a third greater odds of prostate cancer . after stratifying for tumor aggressiveness , they found slightly stronger associations with more aggressive disease , suggesting that regular intake of deep-fried foods may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer as well . what in deep fried foods is so bad for us ? just heating oil that hot can generate potentially carcinogenic compounds , and then known carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when the muscles of chickens and fish are cooked at that temperature . deep-fried plants , on the other hand , can form acrylamide . i did a video about acrylamide back in 2008 , suggesting it ’ s a probable human carcinogen ( see acrylamide in french fries ) . since then , studies have suggested pregnant women may want to cut back on french fries to protect the growth of their baby ’ s body and brain . based on a study ( highlighted in my video , cancer risk from french fries ) feeding people a little bag of potato chips every day for a month , it now seems acrylamide may also cause inflammation as well , which could explain its purported role in cancer progression . acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , lung cancer , kidney cancer , and esophageal cancer . how much cancer risk are we talking about ? taiwanese researchers examined lifetime cancer risk and french fry consumption . the researchers picked on french fries because they comprise by far the greatest percentage contribution of acrylamide to the diets of children . they estimated that , at most , one or two boys and girls out of every ten thousand would develop cancer eating french fries that they would otherwise not have developed if they hadn ’ t eaten french fries . so it ’ s not as bad as eating something like fried fish , or fried chicken , but how much is that saying ? the level of cancer risk in both boys and girls associated with french fries depends on how long and hot they ’ re fried . in europe , the food industry swore that they ’ d self-regulate and control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels , but we ’ ve yet to see any subsequent change in acrylamide levels in french fries . researchers continue to urge that the cooking temperature should be as low as possible and the cooking time should be as short as possible , “ while still maintaining a tasty quality ” of course . we wouldn ’ t want to reduce cancer risk too much — they might not taste as good ! blanching the potatoes first reduces acrylamide formation , but potato chip companies complain that , not only would it muck with the flavor , but it would reduce the nutritional properties by leaching away some of the vitamin c. but if we ’ re relying on potato chips to get our vitamin c , acrylamide is probably the least of our worries . more on heterocyclic amines : there are some things we can do to counteract the effects of these carcinogens , though : i touch on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meat fumes : dietary secondhand smoke and is liquid smoke flavoring carcinogenic ? certain fats may play a role in breast cancer survival as well : breast cancer survival , butterfat , and chicken and breast cancer survival and trans fat . even before the oil gets in the fryer , it ’ s been heavily damaged by the refining process . the multi-step process to take a whole food seed to a refined oil leaves behind oxidized , reactive fatty acids and chemical residues.does this refining process oxidize vegan dha pills , making these fats harmful ? i hope not . great question ! of the well known dietary fatty acids , dha has the highest peroxidation index . do the manufactures add an antioxidant to their dha products ? agreed , great question ! it may be more of a question for the manufacturer . we do know that dha oil from algae appear effective . another study here.yes , but does the dha vegan supplement also provide epa , or just dha ? this is important , no ? i ’ ve seen most vegan dha supplements make no mention of the product containing epa . fish oil has both . maybe you can clear this up for me , i assume i am missing something here in the understanding.leslie : i ’ ve seen quite a few commercial , algea-based omega three pills which include both dha and epa . here ’ s just one example ( not one i ’ m promoting . just the first one that popped up in a random search ) : http : / / www.devanutrition.com / vegan-dha-epa-delayed-release-omega-3.htmli ’ m sure there are also pills with just the dha , but i don ’ t think it is hard to find ones with the epa too if that ’ s what you want.how is it that some algae provide both dha and epa , and others do not ? i figured that algae in itself always contained both the dha and epa , as fish oil contains both dha and epa and the fish get it from eating algae . but some vegan companies say just dha . hmmmm … .leslie : i had assumed that the difference between different pill claims was due to different processing techniques . but you could be right . it could be that the pills which only claim to have dha are simply not reporting the epa ? i really have no clue.hi leslie : most algal dha supplements contain only dha . increasingly though there ’ re products with both dha and epa . if you type in “ vegan omega-3 ″ on amazon , you can find them , but they are even more expensive than algal dha-only products . it ’ s , of course , good to take both dha and epa but not essential because dha and epa equilibrate in the body : if you took only dha , some of it would be converted to epa , and vice versa.i find it thought provoking that the fish oil companies are shifting to balancing their dha epa supplement to contain more epa than dha , as a greater amount of epa than dha in the body has been found to be more effective for mood issues , as well as some feel other issues as well . vegans may be compromising themselves by taking dha only … .creating a level of dha and epa that might adversely effect them.http : / / www.nutraingredients-usa.com / research / epa-stands-alone-as-a-depression-fighterhttps : / / labdoor.com / article / epa-to-dha-ratio-a-benefits-and-risks-analysisseems like a good question for one of the manufacturers like nordic.from the study you linked tohttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23651876 dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women . “ the ‘ healthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains ; while the ‘ unhealthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea and coffee , french fries and potato chips , salt , sweets and desserts , hydrogenated fats , nuts , industrial juice , refined grains , and red and processed meat . ” so – the “ healthy food pattern ” included low fat dairy , olive and vegetable oils , organ meat and poultry ” ! ! and excluded tea ! ? ! this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.this is what dr greger said – “ healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds ” again – the healthier eating pattern included vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains.no matter how you want to spin it you can ’ t.however it would be useful if the good doctor would post a link to the entire study not just the abstract.the study is freely accessible , charles , and can be reached from the source link to the publisher on greger ’ s pubmed citation . greger is quoting his results from table 3 , model ii . i should mention that i misspoke a bit in calling these models ‘ univariate ’ . they focus on only one pattern at a time as the independent variable of interest , but their other statistical controls such as age , menopausal status , etc , are independent variables also . note that i haven ’ t said anything about the quality of greger ’ s reporting on the study yet , either . given that your op talked about the study and not what greger said , i assumed we were talking about what the study itself means.read the study and try to comprehend what i wrote as something other than ‘ spin ’ , then i might get back to you . i assure you that they found two patterns which spanned about 24-31 % of dietary variation in the population , then asked how healthy those patterns actually were . they did not ask up front “ what is the pattern whose variation explains the greatest variation in health outcomes ? ” . the latter form of questioning is well-framed to get you a list that distinguishes apparently healthy foods from apparently unhealthy , while the former is not.this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.a litttle more nuancing might help . i obtain lots of vegetable from my grocery garden , wich i store in my freezer for winter time , after boiling it for a short minute . i may hope that that is not so bad ! as i understand , boiling in water and steaming don ’ t cause acrylamide formation . it ’ s the burning of plant foods due to dry heating that leads to acrylamide.thanks ! the issue for me with fat supplementation is this ; many many people arer taking all kinds of omega ’ s , olive , primrose oils etc . can we clarify the research as to how they oxidize and cause damage ? they layman really has no idea on how to proceed and not create chaos with the oils they take . now dr peter glidden is against all oils for the most part . i think he makes an exception for youngevity efa and maybe coconut oils . any help to clarify would go a long way.great point , anthony . a guest below also had a comment about oxidation . maybe this can be another nutritionfacts research fund project ? dr. greger has a video about the true shelf life of cooking oils . it would be nice to see more on the oils you mention.so would fried coconut oil be safe , and organic potato chips fried in just organic coconut oil not be an issue / problem , as far as arrylamide content as well as oxidation , inflammation ? wondering what you think about this . i have no idea.is it safe to bake potatoes , etc. in the oven brushed with a little olive oil ? what is the temperature at which acrylamide formation becomes a concern ? hi jan . here is a video about the best way to cook sweet potatoes . it ’ s really the french fries ( deep frying ) that is problematic , as they are laden with acrylamide . here is a study looking at acrylamide and temperature . this study mentions how cooking time and temperature may determine acrylamide levels.i watched that video & i like the fact that dr. greger won ’ t compromise quantity of good food vs. quality .. he mentions that best way of eating such a healthy food as sweet potato is how you get most of it .. therefore if someone doesn ’ t have time or facility to boil , they don ’ t have to stop eating it ! one can bake & eat more of it to get same nutrients . that obviously doesn ’ t apply to french fries , but reminds me about some schools or work places , which only provide students / employees with french fries & no better alternative . here the challenge is either eat the deep fried potatoes or stay hungry .. this is a much more difficult decision to make , and for me as an advocate for public health is an example of how important is infrastructure changes to have healthier nation.good information . i will be sharing the informationi will be lurking around the net trying to find out about the dangers of oxidation of oils . if anyone else finds anything please post.beast carcinogen indeedhow about air popped popcorn ? hot temperature ? starch ? short cooking time ? sounds like a recipe for acrylamide . i would be bummed … i love my air popped popcorn. acrylamide , beans , breast cancer , cabbage , cancer , cancer survival , carcinogens , chicken , children , cooking methods , doughnuts , endometrial cancer , endometrial health , esophageal cancer , esophageal health , europe , fish , french fries , frying , greens , heterocyclic amines , industry influence , inflammation , kidney cancer , legumes , lung cancer , men 's health , oils , oral cancer , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , potato chips , poultry , prostate cancer , sweet potatoes , throat cancer , turkey , vitamin c , women 's health - -
PLAIN-2~do cholesterol statin drugs cause breast cancer ? what does breast cancer have to do with cholesterol ? there are many potential mechanisms by which cholesterol boosts breast cancer growth . for example , our bodies make estrogen , which is correlated with an increased risk of breast cancer , out of cholesterol . we also package cholesterol into ldl , which , as you can see in my video cholesterol feeds breast cancer cells , appeared to increase cancer proliferation and decrease patient survival . cholesterol is a major component of “ lipid rafts . ” compared to their normal counterparts , cancer cells have higher levels of these cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in their plasma membrane , which may be important for cancer cell survival and may serve in human cancer development in terms of tumor migration and invasion . elevated levels of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have been found in breast cancer cells , and the hypothesis is that reducing blood cholesterol levels “ may disrupt lipid raft formation and thereby inhibit breast cancer development . ” this suggests cholesterol targeting may be used as a cancer therapy . controlled laboratory experiments have shown that phytosterols in seeds and nuts at dietary relevant levels appear to inhibit the growth of several types of tumor cells including breast cancer cells , including both estrogen-receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive cancer . the therapeutic implications are that “ plant-based diets rich in phytosterols may offer protection against the development of breast cancer . ” of course , you can ’ t make a lot of money on pumpkin seeds , so researchers looked to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs ( this study is highlighted in my video , statin cholesterol drugs and invasive breast cancer ) . some petri dish work looked promising , but population studies have shown mixed results . some studies showed that women on statins had decreased breast cancer risk , some showed increased risk , and most showed no association . these were all relatively short-term studies , though . “ long-term ” statin use was defined as mostly just three to five years , but breast cancer can take decades to grow . the one study that looked at ten or more years of statin use only included 62 cases . given the increase in statin use over the past few decades , and the fact that they ’ re commonly prescribed to be taken every day for the rest of women ’ s lives , the studies published to date only had limited ability to evaluate the impact of long durations of use . we better figure this out : about one in four women over 45 in this country are on these drugs . but that all changed with the publication of a study in 2013 including thousands of breast cancer cases . long term statin users — women taking statins for ten years or more — had more than double the risk of both major types of breast cancer : invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma . once women do get breast cancer , though , recent studies in finland and the uk suggest statin use may improve survival . the number one killer of women is heart disease , not breast cancer , so we still do need to bring down cholesterol levels . might there be a way to get the benefits of cholesterol reduction without the risks ? plant-based diets have been shown to lower ldl-cholesterol by over 30 % , within just a couple weeks , equivalent to most of the standard cholesterol lowering statin drugs and without any breast cancer risk . as drugs go , statins are remarkably safe , but they can still present rare but serious side effects in both men and women ( statin muscle toxicity ) . how can we lower cholesterol without drugs ? it ’ s purely a question of diet . we can lower our cholesterol by lowering our intake of three things : trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero . where are trans fats found ? trans fat in meat and dairy . where is cholesterol found ? predominantly eggs : eggs and cholesterol : patently false and misleading claims . there are also some foods particularly adept at lowering cholesterol levels : off topic , but what does the science say about sprouted greens , like like sprouted sunflower greens ? so many people online and in the health community rave about the therapeutic and nutritional value of eating sprout-greens , as well as sprouted raw beans , and seeds , but is this actually accurate and documented by science or just assumptions , maybe even wrong ? i see a sunflower sprout as something that should probably be left in the ground , for it wants and is designed to grow up to be a big sunflower , no ? wouldn ’ t the baby sprout contain some anti-nutrients to deter ( humans ! ) from stopping its ’ lifecycle to grow up to be a 5 foot flowering , beautiful plant ? we have so many videos on sprouting ! for more information on raw foods i ’ d suggest brenda davis ’ s book , “ becoming raw ” – perhaps the most referenced book on rw foods . she did a guest post about paleo diets , too.does this imply that if a woman who hasn ’ t been on statins develops breast cancer , putting her on statins will increase her chances of survival ? in other words , are statins the next breast-cancer drug ? hi . here is a great video that mentions statins and breast cancer risk that may really help . thanks for your post.http : / / www.medscape.com / viewarticle / 846189 ? src = emailthis a study presented at the american society of clinical oncologists meeting this year said that statins lower the risk of cancer death in some types of cancer . the study says statins don ’ t affect cancer incidence.hi sandra . i can ’ t seem to open your link . do you mind resending ? perhaps we need to update some information , but it seems there is concern of taking statins , as it ’ s associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.it doesn ’ t help that breast cancer and heart disease ( and most dis-eases ) are such sensitive and personal topics for many and i have found it difficult to suggest a healthier diet ( even with referring to blogs like this and medical sites ) when a pill can ‘ do it all ’ . thank you for all the knowledge you share , as it encourages me to stay open-minded and true to my stance.read this today : http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / news / press-releases / treating-more-adults-with-statins-would-be-cost-effective-way-to-boost-heart-health / ?

semi rhetorical question . thanks for the link very interesting.a friend of mine was diagnosed with als last year . one of possible causes of the disease inhis case : 10 year use of statins . the neurologist took him off the medication immediately.i ’ m confused about dietary cholesterol . you appear to imply here and in other places that dietary cholestrol should be avoided as it causes an increase in serum cholesterol , yet even t.collin campbell acknowloges that this is not the case . my understanding is that animal protein causes the body to over-produce cholesterol . maybe it doesn ’ t matter as animal proteins come with lots of cholesterol and sat fat anyway , so the health recommendations would be the same ? i would appreciate some clarification on this . thanks for the great work ! hi marty . let me try to help . saturated fat boosts cholesterol much more than dietary cholesterol , but dietary cholesterol still raises blood cholesterol slightly . this british medical journal blog explains more . dr. greger commented at the end stating “ indeed the institute of medicine did not set a tolerable upper intake limit for cholesterol “ because any intake level above 0 % of energy increased ldl cholesterol concentration . ” [ 1 ] so the optimal intake may indeed by zero , as heart disease remains the leading killer in both the uk and us . [ 1 ] trumbo pr , shimakawa t. tolerable upper intake levels for trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol . nutr rev. 2011 ; 69 ( 5 ) : 270-8 . ” his video on optimal cholesterol levels may also help . animal protein can be detrimental to health in excess , but i am uncertain its effects on cholesterol . i would agree with your statement that “ maybe it doesn ’ t matter as animal proteins come with lots of cholesterol and sat fat anyway . ” is it cholesterol itself that promotes cancer , or is it “ excess ” cholesterol ? i ’ m curious because our bodies create cholesterol as needed . so is it just the excess that we may get from our diet that is a problem or any cholesterol that ’ s a problem ? but that woman in the commercial seems so happy . she acts like she won the lottery when she finds out that she is “ down with crestor ” then she dances down the street , high fiving everybody on her way . her friends congratulate her on the great news.i have normal cholesterol , and i ’ m never * that * happy.these are what i call the “ dancing fat * sses ” … their drugs make them happy … usual corporate swill . i have ch of 145 and i ’ m concerned about it being too low . from what i read the elderly live longer with higher ch … the real issue being oxidized ch … not blood levels.i wonder how many are taking statins when their cholesterol is high due to an iodine deficiency . iodineresearch.comanother translation accomplished in portuguese – http : / / nf.focoempatico.net / estatinas-causam-cancro-da-mama / wow , i ’ d sure like to see that 30 % drop in cholesterol … .i ’ ve been vegan x 3 years , and my levels are still higher than the usual recommended levels.dr. greger says that statins are remarkably safe , considering that they are drugs , and mentions the proviso that occasionally they cause muscle pain . what about diabetes ? i ’ ve read a couple studies indicating that those taking statins have anywhere from 50 % to more than double the rate of contracting diabetes as those not taking statins ( those taking low dose statins had less diabetes ) . breast cancer , cancer , cancer survival , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cholesterol , estrogen , heart disease , heart health , ldl cholesterol , nuts , phytosterols , plant-based diets , plasma membrane , pumpkin seeds , seeds , side effects , statins , vegans , vegetarians , women 's health - -
PLAIN-3~breast cancer cells feed on cholesterol one in eight american women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime . there are a number of compounds in plant foods that may protect against breast cancer by a variety of mechanisms . i ’ ve talked about the benefits of broccoli , flaxseeds , and soy foods before ( see breast cancer survival vegetable , flaxseeds & breast cancer prevention , and breast cancer survival and soy ) but a recent german study reported something new . the researchers found that sunflower and pumpkin seeds were associated with reduced breast cancer risk . they initially chalked the association up to the lignans in the seeds ( see breast cancer survival and lignan intake ) , but their lignan lead didn ’ t pan out . maybe it ’ s the phytosterols found concentrated in seeds ? ( see optimal phytosterol source ) . there is evidence that phytosterols may be anticancer nutrients and play a role in reducing breast cancer risk . i thought phytosterols just lowered cholesterol ? ( see how phytosterols lower cholesterol ) what does cancer have to do with cholesterol ? increasing evidence demonstrates the role that cholesterol may play in the development and progression of breast cancer . cancer feeds on cholesterol . transformed cells take up ldl , so-called “ bad ” cholesterol , and it ’ s capable of stimulating the growth of human breast cancer cells in a petri dish . the ability to accumulate fat and cholesterol may enable cancer cells to take advantage of people eating high fat and high cholesterol diets and at least partially explain the benefit of a low-fat diet on lowering human breast cancer recurrence . although the data has been mixed , the largest study to date ( highlighted in my video , cholesterol feeds breast cancer cells ) found a 17 % increased breast cancer risk in women who had a total cholesterol over 240 compared to women whose cholesterol was under 160 . however , the researchers could not rule out that there may be something else in cholesterol-raising foods that ’ s increasing breast cancer risk . tumors suck up so much cholesterol that ldl has been considered a vehicle for delivering antitumor drugs to cancer cells . since cancer feeds on cholesterol , maybe we could stuff some chemo into it like a trojan horse poison pill ? the uptake of ldl into tumors may be why people ’ s cholesterol levels drop low after they get cancer — the tumor is eating it up . in fact , patient survival may be lowest when cholesterol uptake is highest . “ high ldl receptor content in breast cancer tissue seems to indicate a poor prognosis , [ suggesting ] that breast tumors rich in ldl receptors may grow rapidly [ in the body ] . ” we ’ ve known about this for decades . you can tell that was an old study because , when it was published in the ‘ 80s , only 1 in 11 american women got breast cancer . if cholesterol increases breast cancer risk , what about the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs ? see statin cholesterol drugs and invasive breast cancer . more videos on broccoli and soy ’ s protective effects against breast cancer : some i didn ’ t mention include : when i eat fresh stalks of celery my mouth goes tingly and numb . someone below ( i included their comments ) said that it was caused by a chemical in celery . others have told me it is from eugenol in celery.someone told me it was caused by eugenol in celery , and this can be toxic to some people . chemicals such as furanocoumourans as well ? anyway , would longterm exposure to this possibly cause harm to lining of stomach , gi tract , if it irritates the mouth like this ? doesn ’ t happen every time but it does tend to happen , even if the celery is fresh picked , vibrant , and organic.wondering if anyone else has experienced this reaction.thanks.yeah it makes the celery taste weird . not experiencing it to your level though . cook it in soups and the effect is gone.could it be the oxalates causing this sensation ? darker , outer stalks are higher in oxalate than the inner blanched stalks . interestingly , celery is the only thing that will halt my severe nausea , although i too sometimes observe an uncomfortable feeling in my mouth when i eat it . pineapple too , is high in oxalate , and causes me similar although slightly different sensations , and sun sensitivity . i ’ ve read we can have too much oxalate , causing a buildup ; possibly a reason for the “ sometimes ” , rather then every time ? oh , and to what the previous comment says , i ’ ve also read that boiling can reduce oxalate.pineapple is not a commonly allergenic food , is not known to contain measurable amounts of oxalates or purines.http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = foodspice & dbid = 34in fact , pineapple ’ s bromelain content is why it ’ s considered an anti-inflammatory food.therefore , it must be something else in pineapples causing that “ mouth ripped to shreds ” feeling , rather than oxalates . it could be merely the physical properties of the fiber , perhaps.k. did a google search : it ’ s the bromelain.http : / / www.popsugar.com / food / burning-question-why-does-pineapple-irritate-your-mouth-3098109https : / / www.google.com / search ?

” can ’ t wait to have study after study being thrown at my face for an hour . i had to watch the previous year-in-review 2-3 times to absorb all that information.yes ! soon ! http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 26103605 http : / / www.mdlinx.com / cardiology / medical-news-article / 2015 / 07 / 15 / anticardiovascular-diet / 6235276 / ?

also , are these eggs from free range or factory fed chickens ? . it seems that some are harmed by dietary cholesterol from egg yolks , while others may benefit.hi ian . perhaps both are important . i linked many resources above that helps answer the dietary cholesterol question . here is a post about free-range vs. conventional eggs and cholesterol.dr. help me with this . cholesterol is made by the liver . eating cholesterol rich foods like eggs does not increase cholesterol in blood or does it ? it sure can . have you seen dr. greger ’ s testimony . if not you may be interested in the communication / a > . i think he is at 2 : 06 : 00 . another speaker is dr. barnard who addresses the issue at hand . he is probably like 15 min before dr. greger , addressing the aha / acc report directly and then dr. greger follows-up on it . another write-up that explains the confusion between dietary cholesterol . and i mention all of these links within this blog , peek behind the egg industry curtain . dietary cholesterol still appears to be a concern.this site also recommends nori for breast cancer prevention. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / which-seaweed-is-most-protective-against-breast-cancer / this video says a single sheet of nori a day can cut your risk of breast cancer in half.thanks for sharing this , matthew ! just a quick tip ( since i know you are an experienced user here ) , dr. greger usually does a great job at relating topics and hyperlinking in the doctor ’ s note . the doctor ’ s note is where i look first to find related articles and to help answer questions ! it looks like he mentions how nuts , mushrooms , greens , and seaweed may help reduce breast cancer risk.thanks i don ’ t see how i missed that.is dr. greger planning on publishing more data on intervening with diet after a cancer diagnosis ? the list of anti cancer foods according to this website include : nuts walnuts , pecans , peanuts vegetables garlic , beets , broccoli beans black beans , lentils fruits cranberries , lemons , apples spices turmeric ( with pepper ) , rosemary , ginger tea matcha , white tea with lemon , hibiscusthe five year survival rate of cancer is about half . with diet , that rate can be doubled to ten years for some individuals.using selenium rich foods like brazil nuts and garlic could help prevent cancer . some individuals achieve a similar benefit with vitamins . did you know that they say modern medical interventions are only 3 percent effective ? i wish your results were more widely published and widely available.biological fact : cholesterol is a steroid hormone . question : what value is there in stating that a hormone ( and esp. cholesterol of all of them ) affects the growth of a cancer ? sorry but in this particular post , you ’ re stating the obvious.don ’ t stop at cholesterol , don ’ t stop at igf-1 , go to the core ! hgh why don ’ t you look instead at the hgh hormone and the link with diet ? that will be more interesting ! did you know people whose pituitary gland was flashed with 12,5 mci of gamma radiation with a gamma knife or gamma unit find the production of hgh selectively inhibited and can no longer develop cancers or diabetes ? ( schaub ) is there a link between that mother hormone that hgh is , and diet ? i think higher insulin is as cancer promoting as hgh ? too many refined carbs ? i ’ ve read that most people after the age of 50 have incipient cancer ( s ) . if you are older and have issues with minor chronic infections … too many colds … etc … probably a good idea to try and boost the immune system ? i have breast cancer . in may of 2015 , i went to an event at the new school in nyc . the featured speaker was paul stamets . the event was packed , every single seat was taken and people were even sitting in the aisle . among other things , paul stamets said that his mother had been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and given just 3 months to live . her oncologist would not recommend chemotherapy / radiation because she was too old and the cancer too advanced . however , the oncologist did recommend turkey tail mushroom . paul stamets , played an audio of his mother calling about mundane matters and he said that was several years after her diagnosis . he mentioned other miracle stuff like that during the presentation , involving other deadly diseases . after the presentation , i went to wholefoods supermarket which is just a few blocks down the street to buy turkey tail mushroom as a supplement . the wholefoods clerk was already handing ttm to people that had been at the same event and wanted to buy it . i have been taking ttm since that time , till now . i did mention to my oncologist at sloan kettering that i was taking turkey tail and brought her a booklet detailing all the different mushrooms and what they are good for , that was given out at the event at the new school . the only thing i can see , is that my left breast is a lot smaller than my right breast , which is noticeably bigger . i have an appointment with my oncologist and surgeon , because i called them and told them about the size difference . i was wondering if you had ever heard of turkey tail mushroom and its supposed effects on breast cancer , dr. greger , i watched ​ his talk on ted and he says that she in fact took two powerful and agressive drugs along with the mushroom : taxol ( which is chemootherapy ) and herceptin ( kind of chemo , too ) . so , i am not saying the mushroom did nothing for her , on the contrary , but it was not only the mushroom . dr. greger does have a video on mushrooms in the prevention of breast cancer , but treatment is a different thing – i would be interested in this , too.i have had radiation , but no chemotherapy . and yes , you are right he did say his mother took another drug in addition to turkey tail mushroom . i was just surprised to see that many people in wholefoods , that had attended the same event , lining up for turkey tail mushroom.link to ted talk not working just fyi ; - ) thanks , joseph ! i edited the comment and put the direct link instead ! hi gadea . we have so much information on mushrooms . the fda approved a trial on turkey tail mushrooms in 2012 . there may have been many more since . it sounds like you ’ ve done some homework ! i am so glad you are asking these questions and communicating with your oncologist at sloan-kettering . i ’ ve heard of some great dietitians who work there . i have not read any research about mushrooms reducing breast size , but i suppose as long as there are no additional risks taking mushrooms than why not include them in your diet ? mushrooms contain beta-glucan fiber and can be thought of as immunomodulators.i started on turkey tail mushroom since i heard paul stamets at the new school . he talked them up . while he was careful to say , that he did not attribute any miracle cures to them , he nevertheless implied that repeatedly . i have always included white button mushrooms in my diet . i had an appointment with my oncologist dr. elizabeth comen at sloan kettering and she did not put much stock in paul stamets claims . i had a booklet that was given out and she browsed through it . but i take ttm anyway.thank you , dr.greger for all extremly useful informations . i wnat know your position to canabis oil therapy breast cancer ( and all rests too , and almost all chronical diseases , together with 80 % raw fruits and 15 % raw vegetables and5 % seeds diet . is this combination raw plant diet + canabis oil without psychoactive supstances , the best solution against cancer ( and many of other diseases ) ? thank you with all my heart for all what you do with your videos . md s.mazak beslic , serbiai don ’ t believe there ’ s data for cannabis ’ s role in cancer treatment beyond symptom management for the most part . there is some minor evidence for its use with brain tumors , but i haven ’ t seen breast cancer data . the oncology nutrition group of the academy of nutrition and dietetics is spotlighting a session on “ marijuana : is it medicine yet for cancer symptom management ? ” . it will be interesting to see where alternative treatments can advance cancer research . i like your point about lots of raw foods in the diet , as of course nutrition can play such an important role in cancer prevention and treatment.engaging into translating and republishing all contents from nutritionfacts.org into portuguese . i am sure that we can shift this culture even faster if we go beyond language barriers . any suggestions on this initiative ?

PLAIN-4~using diet to treat asthma and eczema i previously discussed the power of fruits and vegetables to help prevent and treat asthma and allergies . if adding a few more servings of fruits and vegetables may help asthma , what about a diet centered around plants ? twenty patients with allergic eczema were placed on a vegetarian diet . at the end of two months , their disease scores , which covered both subjective and objective signs and symptoms , were cut in half , similar to what we might see using one of our most powerful drugs . the drug works much quicker , within about two weeks , but since drugs can often include dangerous side effects the dietary option is more attractive . this was no ordinary vegetarian diet , however . this was an in-patient study using an extremely calorically-restricted diet — the subjects were practically half fasting . therefore , we don ’ t know which component was responsible for the therapeutic effect . what about using a more conventional plant-based diet against a different allergic disease , asthma ? in sweden , there was an active health movement that claimed that a vegan diet could improve or cure asthma . this was a bold claim , so in order to test this , a group of orthopedic surgeons at linköping university hospital followed a series of patients who were treated with a vegan regimen for one year . ( this study is highlighted in my video , treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . ) participants had to be willing to go completely plant-based , and they had to have physician-verified asthma of at least a year ’ s duration that wasn ’ t getting better or was getting worse despite the best medical therapies available . the researchers found quite a sick group to follow . the thirty-five patients had long-established , hospital-verified bronchial asthma for an average duration of a dozen years . of the 35 patients , 20 had been admitted to the hospital for acute asthmatic attacks during the last two years . of these , one patient had received acute infusion therapy ( emergency iv drugs ) a total of 23 times during this period and another patient claimed he had been to the hospital 100 times during his disease and on every occasion had evidently required such treatments . one patient even had a cardiac arrest during an asthma attack and had been brought back to life on a ventilator . these were some pretty serious cases . the patients were on up to eight different asthma medicines when they started , with an average of four and a half drugs , and were still not getting better . twenty of the 35 were constantly using cortisone , which is a powerful steroid used in serious cases . these were all fairly advanced cases of the disease , more severe than the vegan practitioners were used to . eleven couldn ’ t stick to the diet for a year , but of the 24 that did , 71 % reported improvement at four months and 92 % at one year . these were folks that had not improved at all over the previous year . concurrently with this improvement , the patients greatly reduced their consumption of medicine . four had completely given up their medication altogether , and only two weren ’ t able to at least drop their dose . they went from an average of 4.5 drugs down to 1.2 , and some were able to get off cortisone . some subjects said that their improvement was so considerable they felt like “ they had a new life . ” one nurse had difficulty at work because most of her co-workers were smokers , but after the plant-based regimen she could withstand the secondhand smoke without getting an attack and could tolerate other asthma triggers . others reported the same thing . whereas previously they could only live in a clean environment and felt more or less isolated in their homes , they could now go out without getting asthmatic attacks . the researchers didn ’ t find only subjective improvements . they also found a significant improvement in a number of clinical variables , most importantly in measures of lung function , vital capacity , forced expiratory volume , and physical working capacity , as well as significant drops in sed rate ( a marker of inflammation ) and ige ( allergy associated antibodies ) . the study started out with 35 patients who had suffered from serious asthma for an average of 12 years , all receiving long-term medication , with 20 using cortisone , who were “ subjected to vegan food for a year , ” and , in almost all cases , medication was withdrawn or reduced , and asthma symptoms were significantly reduced . despite the improved lung function tests and lab values , the placebo effect can ’ t be discounted since there was no blinded control group . however , the nice thing about a healthy diet is that there are only good side effects . the subjects ’ cholesterol significantly improved , their blood pressures got better , and they lost 18 pounds . from a medical standpoint , i say why not give it a try ? if you missed the first three videos of this 4-part series here are the links : more on eczema and diet can be found in my videos : there are a number of other conditions plant-based diets have been found to be effective in treating : i am confused about coconut fat . is it the processed and extracted coconut oil that increases gut permbeability only ? or does the fresh coconut meat also cause inflammation and increase gut permeability ? thank you.i am not sue about gut permeability and coconut oil , specifically . i did not see anything in the literature on human studies . fresh coconut and coconut water are probably the best types . dr greger points out the differences in this video between saturated fat from coconut vs. animal fat . from the transcript “ unlike saturated animal fats , coconut oil doesn ’ t cause that spike inflammation immediately after consumption of animal foods , which makes sense because as you ’ ll remember it may be the dead bacterial endotoxins in animal products ferried into the body by saturated fat that are to blame . ” two recent reports on coconut oil that may help : cspi report on coconut oilforks over knives reportyeah i too would like to know if coconut flesh is inflammatory , and if it increase gut permeability like other high saturated fat foods.my wife is > 3 years vegetarian and > 0,5 years vegan . however it does not seem that her diet affected her eczema anyhow . what is she missing ? “ scd diet ” , but do a vegan version of it . follow it 100 % .i work in a skin care clinic as a laser technician and we recommend a product called juice plus . we have seen so many people improve their health including eczema . its a variety of 30 fruits veg and berries in a convenient capsule or chew form . the vineyard blend ( berries and grapes ) is the powerhouse when it comes to improving eczema due to its circulatory properties . we find it easy to recommend as its safe as its 100 % food and its nsf certified . its so hard to get that much needed 7-13 servings of fruits and vegetables daily … .. i know better and i still don ’ t do it ! i can send some before and after photos if you ’ d like or if you would like any more info you can check out my website at http : / / www.marnie.canada.juiceplus.com switch the website at the top depending what country you are in . its a frustrating skin condition for many so i hope my info helps : ) you could consider supplementing with d3 , https : / / www.vitamindcouncil.org / health-conditions / eczema / # it is recommeneded here for all folks.hi there . it is hard to say what is best . i would need more more information about the diet . have you seen all of our videos on eczema ? some of these might help . you may consider eliminating certain foods that may or may not be linked to skin health . i also suggest seeing a dermatologist and dietitian familiar with skin conditions . let me know if you need help finding one.i have been vegetarian all my life ( 30 + years old ) but still deal with eczema / dry skin symptoms . any ideas / suggestions ? hi sk , perhaps flaxseed may help ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / flaxseeds-for-sensitive-skin / perhaps you ought to talk to an md who is familiar with doing blood testing for identifying various viruses that also can impact eczema / skin problems . once your md can identify the specific virus involved – since many vaccines automatically contain hidden animal viruses depending upon excipients , etc. used ; plus they also can contain “ mycoplasmas ” – you can address your problem , including maintaining a low lysine diet , i.e. , eliminate foods that are high in lysine , which “ feed ” viruses . just a suggestion that may help.i thought viruses feed off of arginine , and that lysine inhibits and fights them , no ? cold sore remedy ( herpes virus ) is to avoid arginine foods and add more lysine.you might want to correct this statement . lysine has been show to do the opposite.hi catherine , this comment went to me but i think you meant for it to go to sk . they may not have seen your reply.look into pygnogenol . it is found in very small quantities in the peels of some fruits.you could have your vitamin d3 levels checked. https : / / www.vitamindcouncil.org / health-conditions / eczema / # do you get enough sunshine ? regarding eczema , it has both genetic and environmental factors involved . lots of factors can exacerbate the condition such as stress , contact with irritating substances and soaps , cold & dry climates or heat & sweat . avoiding animal products would definitely decrease inflammation associated with eczema , but considering these factors would help you better deal with the problem . interestingly according to among treatments are mentioned short warm showers vs. long hot showers and mild soap and moisturizers . also exercise and reducing stress can improve the condition.have you seen all of our videos on eczema ? some of these might help . coconut oil on the skin may help , and of course seeing the dermatologist to discuss the right lotions or ointments can help . you may consider eliminating certain foods like eggs or wheat or milk , as some folks have allergies to these foods.as far as what diet to follow , there are ( conflicting ) websites like this one : http : / / www.flawlessprogram.com / 2014 / 10 / 01 / eat-these-superfoods-for-eczema-healthy-gut / on a different topic . i am interested in using diet to improve or manage polycystic kidney disease . i am familiar with the tanner rat studies , but i ’ m not aware of any other research having been carried out . as it also affects the liver and other internal organs , it obviously has wider implications . can you give any more information please , and does it depend on how much the disease has progressed ? i ’ m also interested in the effects acupuncture can have . have any interventions , other than drugs , been successful ? thank you for your help and the fascinating articles.hi helen . here are our videos on kidney disease and one on kidney failure . i am not sure it pertains to polycystic kidney disease . this foundation has more information on the disease . they claim “ at present , no specific diet is known to prevent cysts from developing in patients with pkd . reducing salt intake helps control blood pressure in pkd patients who have high blood pressure . a diet low in fat and moderate in calories is recommended to maintain a healthy weight . speak to your doctor or a dietitian about other changes to your diet , such as avoiding caffeine . ” strains of lactobacillus reuteri are said to help with asthma ( as well as colic ) : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22691248 , http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25444531 . my cow ’ s milk kefir contains l reuteri – are there other sources ?

PLAIN-5~treating asthma with plants vs. pills in my video treating asthma with fruits and vegetables , i highlighted a landmark study on manipulating antioxidant intake in asthma . the study found that just a few extra fruits and vegetables a day can powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates . if the antioxidants in the plants are ameliorating asthma , then why can ’ t we take antioxidant pills instead ? because antioxidant pills don ’ t appear to work . studies using antioxidant supplements on respiratory or allergic diseases have mostly shown no beneficial effects . this discrepancy between data relating to fruit and vegetable intake compared with those using antioxidant supplements may indicate the importance of the whole food , rather than individual components . for example , in the harvard nurse ’ s health study , women who got the most vitamin e from their diet appeared to be at half the risk for asthma , ( which may help explain why nut consumption is associated with significantly lower rates of wheezing ) , but vitamin e supplements did not appear to help . men who eat a lot of apples appear to have superior lung function , as do kids who eat fresh fruit every day , as measured by fev1 ( basically how much air you can forcibly blow out in one second ) . the more fruit , salad , and green vegetables kids ate , the greater their lung function appeared . researchers are “ cautious about concluding which nutrient might be responsible . ” there ’ s vitamin c in fruits , salads , and green vegetables , but there are lots of other antioxidants , such as “ vitamin p , ” a term used to describe polyphenol phytonutrients found in grapes , flax seeds , beans , berries , broccoli , apples , citrus , herbs , tea , and soy . polyphenol phytonutrients can directly bind to allergenic proteins and render them hypoallergenic , allowing them to slip under our body ’ s radar . if this first line of defense fails , polyphenols can also inhibit the activation of the allergic response and prevent the ensuing inflammation , and so may not only work for prevention , but for treatment as well . most of the available evidence is weak , though , in terms of using supplements containing isolated phytonutrients to treat allergic diseases . we could just give people fruits and vegetables to eat , but then we couldn ’ t perform a double-blind study to see if they work better than placebo . some researchers decided to use pills containing plant food extracts . plant extracts are kind of a middle ground . they are better than isolated plant chemicals , but are not as complete as whole foods . still , since we can ’ t put whole foods in a capsule , we can compare the extracts to fake sugar pills that look and feel the same to see if they have an effect . the first trial involved giving people extracts of apple skins . i ’ ve talked about the japan ’ s big cedar allergy problem before ( see alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies ) , so apple extract pills were given every day for a few months starting right before pollen season started . the results were pretty disappointing . they found maybe a little less sneezing , but the extract didn ’ t seem to help their stuffy noses or itchy eyes . what about a tomato extract ? a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled eight-week trial was performed on perennial allergic rhinitis , this time not for seasonal pollen , but for year-round allergies to things like dust-mites . there are lots of drugs out there , but you may have to take them every day year-round , so how about some tomato pills instead ? after oral administration of tomato extract for eight weeks , there was a significant improvement of total nasal symptom scores , combined sneezing , runny nose and nasal obstruction , with no apparent adverse effects . would whole tomatoes work even better ? if only researchers would design an experiment directly comparing phytonutrient supplements to actual fruits and vegetables head-to-head against asthma , but such a study had never been done … until now . the same amazing study , highlighted in my video , treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? , that compared the seven-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet to the three-fruit-and-vegetables-a-day diet , after completion of its first phase , commenced a parallel , randomized , controlled supplementation trial with capsules of tomato extract , which boosted the power of five tomatoes in one little pill , and the study subjects were given three pills a day . who did better , the group that ate seven servings of actual fruits and vegetables a day , or the group that ate three servings a day but also took 15 supposed serving equivalents in pill form ? the pills didn ’ t help at all . improvements in lung function and asthma control were evident only after increased fruit and vegetable intake , which suggests that whole-food interventions are most effective . both the supplements and increased fruit and vegetable intake were effective methods for increasing carotenoid concentrations in the bloodstream , but who cares ? clinical improvements — getting better from disease — were evident only as a result of an increase in plant , not pill , consumption . the results provide further evidence that whole-food approaches should be used to achieve maximum efficacy of antioxidant interventions . and if this is what a few more plants can do , what might a whole diet composed of plants accomplish ? see treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . i also dealt with preventing asthma in the first place : preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables . the theme of whole foods being more efficacious than supplements seems to come up over and over again . see for example : more on “ vitamin p ” in how to slow brain aging by two years . the anti-inflammatory effects of nuts may explain the harvard nurse ’ s health study finding : fighting inflammation in a nut shell . maybe the asthma trick is in what not to eat . if they ate a pill instead of the whole fruit , they would not displaced the animal foods ( could be allergenic in some people ) . they would eat the same diet plus the extra pill . switching the thought process of missing something ( a + $ $ $ pill ) to taking something out ( animal - $ $ $ ) could be scientific too.vegan regimen with reduced medication in the treatment of bronchial asthma . : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 4019393thanks for the study link . from the related articles it looks like yoga can help , too.as an asthma sufferer , i can say that pills help tremendously . if i take around 7,000 mg vitamin c a day , my symptoms are greatly decreased . but i have to take at least that much or no benefits . i ’ d like to see studies on taking much more vitamin c than what ’ s normally recommended . i ’ ve had friends who do vitamin c iv ’ s … around 50,000mg given through the blood . prescribed by a doctor of course . it totally stops their symptoms . maybe the fillers in vitamins have something to do with effectiveness ? hi amanda . thanks for you comment . i suppose the fillers could be problematic if allergic to a substance that it contains . good to know your doctor is prescribing the high dose vitamin c and you are not injecting yourself ! if it works for you and you ’ re finding relief then more power to ya ! so many folks suffer from asthma ( like my baby cousin ) that i am happy to hear when something works.have you tried having your vitamin d3 levels checked ? here ’ s what boggles the mind . my choice then is to either ( a ) pick a juicy , healthy , fruit off a tree ( or buy it for peanuts at the local market ) and enjoy it as a snack , or ( b ) pop something that has been processed to the hilt with artificial flavouring ( gross ) , that would cost me more , has negligible benefits and perhaps even a negative side effect or two to boot . why would we willingly spend money on something so distasteful when a perfectly tastier , healthier , cheaper option is available ? what am i missing here ? ? sounds good to me ! perhaps convenience and unhealthful dietary patterns interfere with choosing fresh fruits and vegetables ? access to foods could be another part , but i agree with you 100 % that choice “ a ” is preferred . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed ! thanks for your comment , tikiri.it ’ s unfortunate the nutritionfacts articles do not carry citations as do the videos . i ’ m curious as to what “ extracts ” are and whether they differ from “ concentrates ” , as in juice plus.hi steve , the following sources regarding apple and tomato extracts are hyperlinked within the text above : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15849424http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17519582http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22854412thanks . i should have noticed that.the hyperlinks for individual studies aren ’ t bolded as the video titles are , and are a rather subdued green as opposed to the bright blue we ’ re used to seeing . they can be easy to miss ! enjoy the articles . : ) thanks for asking , steve. b00mer is right we do link the studies but they are in the hyperlinks for blogs . you can still find them . the study will go into more depth on type of extract . as for “ juice plus ” , dr. greger has a few videos on that supplement.thanks.last october my son was coming to visit and he is a vegan . i bought almond milk in preparation for his arrival , so for about a week i was not drinking dairy . i began to notice that my breathing was easier . after he left i took myself off all dairy and within another week was off my asthma meds . no more daily inhaled steroids . i ’ m also off benadryl now . if i get around cats and dogs for extended periods i might need a rescue inhaler , but overall my symptoms are much better.wow that is amazing ! dairy can be a major allergen for many folks . i am so glad you are finding relief . that ’ s why i love nutritionfacts.org because the public can visit the site for free and learn about crucial nutrition topics . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed . thanks , jim.i know what you mean about dairy.when i was a kid i had asthma i drank milk back then as i got older i drank less milk but more sodas but my asthma went away.never made the connection until about a year ago when i found out the real truth about dairy.this spring when the pollen was falling like snow everyone around me was sniffing and snorting and complaining about congestion but i was free and clear.i tell everyone i talk to about diet that if you want better health at least ditch the dairy at least ; ) so the big idea is more fruits and vegetables for more plant fiber . we recommend bacon ! made from eggplant . here is a link to our vegan bacon video . spoiler alert : there ’ s turmeric in there . < 3 whirled peas kitchen https : / / youtu.be / avcpoqhwpocallan : another winner ! i ’ ve heard of processed vegan bacon , coconut bacon , and of course , tempeh bacon . i ’ ve never heard of eggplant bacon before this . you make it look absolutely delicious . and i really liked how you gave the overview at the beginning.that ’ s too much work for me . but sure do hope i will get to try it some time in the future . thanks for the link ! just a heads-up on some scary tv viewing tonight on frontline . hunting the nightmare bacteria . can also be seen online . it gives good reason to stay healthy and avoid all hospital stays.asthma is not dependant on vitamin c. vitamin d3 has been found in a number of people to treat and cure asthma . you can read “ the miraculous results of extremely high doses of the sunshine hormone vitamin d3 my experiment with huge doses of d3 from 25,000 to 50,000 to 100,000 iu a day over a 1 year period ” by jeff bowles for more information on how to use d3 to cure asthma . many people are very deficient in vitamin c and vitamin e , those being some of the vitamins lost to the mills.i ’ m confused about reaching 9-13 servings of fruits and vegetables , as the usda uses cups now instead . when you refer to a serving of fruit , is that the previously used usda serving size of about 1 / 2 cup for most and 1 cup for leafy greens ? or is each serving now 1 cup for most and 2 cups for leafy greens ? i find references to both measurements as a serving online . i don ’ t think i ’ m the only one confused ! : ) thank you so much ! i agree with lilackitty , this is an important question . how much exactly is a “ serving ? ” thank you , drs. greger and gonzales , for the constant stream of life giving information.good questions . the guidelines always seem to be changing . usda now uses cups . 5 cups ( servings ) total of fruits and vegetables is the minimum to shoot for , but more is definitely preferred . here is a guide to what counts as a serving for vegetables and fruits. allergies , antioxidants , apples , asthma , beans , berries , broccoli , children , citrus , flax seeds , fruit , grapes , harvard nurses ' health study , herbs , inflammation , japan , lung disease , lung health , nuts , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , polyphenols , protein , respiratory infections , salads , soy , sugar , supplements , tea , tomatoes , vegetables , vitamin c , vitamin e - -
PLAIN-6~how fruits and vegetables can treat asthma in my video preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables , i highlighted an international study of asthma and allergies involving more than a million kids . the study found a consistent inverse relationship between prevalence rates of asthma , allergies , and eczema and the intake of plants , starch , grains , and vegetables . researchers speculated “ over a decade ago that if these findings could be generalized , and if the average daily consumption of these foods increased , an important decrease in symptom prevalence could be achieved . ” no need to speculate any more , though , because plants were finally put to the test . researchers have proposed that “ by eating fewer fruits and vegetables , the susceptibility to potentially harmful inhaled substances of the population as a whole may be increased because of the reduction in antioxidant defenses of the lungs . ” the thin lining of fluid that forms the interface between our respiratory tract and the external environment is our first line of defense against oxidative damage . oxidative damage is important in asthma , contributing to airway contraction , excessive mucous production , and hypersensitivity . antioxidants protect against oxidative stress , so our lung lining contains a range of antioxidants our body makes itself , as well as those obtained from our diet , particularly from fruits and vegetables . we can even quantify the level of oxidative stress in people by measuring the level of oxidation products in their exhaled breath , which drops as we start eating more fruits and vegetables , and drops further as we combine more plants with fewer animal foods . do those with asthma really have lower levels of antioxidants than people without asthma ? compared to healthy controls , subjects with asthma had lower whole blood levels of total carotenoids and lower levels of each of the individual phytonutrients they measured : cryptoxanthin , lycopene , lutein , alpha-carotene and beta-carotene compared to healthy controls . therefore , they posit , “ the accumulating evidence does suggest that diet has an influence in modulating the response of the lung to inhaled allergens and irritants . however , it is possible that the reduced carotenoid levels in asthma are a result of increased utilization in the presence of excess free radicals . ” so it ’ s like a chicken-or-the-egg phenomenon . we know antioxidant-rich diets have been associated with reduced asthma prevalence . however , direct evidence that altering intake of antioxidant-rich foods actually affects asthma was lacking , until now . there are two ways to test the effects of fruits and vegetables on asthma . add fruits and vegetables to people ’ s diets and see if their asthma improves , or take asthmatics and remove fruits and vegetables from their diets and see if they get worse . the first such study of its kind , highlighted in my video , treating asthma with fruits and vegetables , placed subjects with asthma on a low antioxidant diet . after just a matter of days , there was a significant worsening of lung function and asthma control . the researchers conclude that , “ this finding is highly significant for subjects with asthma , as it indicates that omitting antioxidant-rich foods from the diet , for even a short time frame , will have a detrimental effect on asthma symptoms . ” ironically , the low antioxidant diet consumed by subjects , where they were restricted to one serving of fruit and up to two servings of vegetables per day , is typical of western diets . in other words , the low antioxidant diet they used to worsen people ’ s asthma , crippling their lung function , was just like the standard american diet . as about “ half the population usually consumes a diet with an intake of fruit and vegetables equivalent to that in the study diet or less , it appears likely that this dietary pattern , which must be considered suboptimal for lung health , may have a significant impact on asthma management , indicating the potential for typical western dietary patterns to contribute to a worsening of lung function and asthma control . ” within just days , cutting down fruit and vegetable intake can impair lung function , but does adding fruits and vegetables help with asthma ? that was the second phase of the study . asthmatics on the standard american diet had about a 40 % chance of relapsing into an asthma exacerbation within three months . however , put them on seven servings of fruits and vegetables a day instead of three , and we cut their exacerbation rate in half , down to 20 % . imagine if there were a drug that could work as powerfully as a few fruits and vegetables . if manipulating antioxidant intake by increasing fruit and vegetable intake can so powerfully reduce asthma exacerbation rates , why not just take antioxidant pills instead ? i cover that in my video treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? and if a few extra servings of fruits and vegetables can make that kind of difference , what about a whole diet composed of plants ? check out treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . what else might antioxidant-rich diets help with ? see : how many antioxidants should we shoot for ? see : where are antioxidants found the most ? i ’ m not surprised , but since i have had a melanoma , what do you think of that association of citrus with melanoma ? i don ’ t think growing up in australia and getting a widespread deep partial thickness sunburn that caused me to miss 6 weeks of school helped much . i also wonder if kids near citrus eat more and if it is really the sun exposure ? hi robert . a few site users were discussing this in an earlier blog . see our comments and links , here . from one study mentioned it seems citrus juice and grapefruit was the potential culprits , but the authors conclude more research is needed before any strict claims against citrus is confirmed.thank you.a psoralen video highlighting the foods that contain it would be timely by dr. greger . figs , citrus , celery , and much more . these foods can increase sunburn potential , for some in a real bad way . i get fried after eating celery and figs . badly . lips burn real bad after figs and getting some sunshine . very few aware of this phenomenon.it is worth reading the study if you have a history of melanoma . they carefully controlled for sun exposure and a bunch of other things . it is the second time this association has been found ( albeit the first time was with one of the two cohorts in the study ) . it is diet in adults they looked at , not kids . the researchers suspect it is to do with the psoralens in citrus ; note that psoralens are also high in a large family of veges that includes carrots , celery , parsnip , parsely , coriander , cumin , dill and others . for those of us with past severe sunburn and melanoma history the dna damage is already done , but it may pay to consider the amount of psoralens in your diet so as not to encourage progression of other melanomas – eg , not to consume a lot of carrot and orange / celery juice.thank you very much . i am an md , like dr greger , who thinks that diet and other lifestyle interventions are the most important interventions . i will take your advice kate and follow the study . i am so glad dr greger added joseph gonzales rd as he is prompt and thoughtful.i ’ ve been grappling with the issues of plant based diet now for over a year now , and wish there were more about how to ensure we get it right . my blood sugar went up , my teeth are suffering , the carbs are high on this diet compared to my old meaty , fattier one . but i got rid of acid reflux and lost weight on the plant based diet . i intend to win at it , but it ’ s not as easy as changing one ’ s food preferences . dr. greger sometimes gives us glimpses of his diet and that is very helpful . the blueberry amla soymilk smoothie i ’ m going to try out . i know his would not necessarily be for everyone , but it would help to have his menu and supplement choices as a sample of workable plan that has the research behind it , not that it ’ s medical advice , just common sense gained from observing research . when i mention the whole food plant-based diet to people , they are often sold already , but have heard horror stories or tried it themselves without a good plan and failed . they were not happy they had to abandon it , since they like the good effects . it ’ s sort of sad.bobluhrs : i ’ m glad you are having some partial success . i agree that the devil is in the details and it would be better to have full success . i also agree that seeing some meal plans that are backed by the best science is very helpful . i have some ideas for you : 1 ) check out the book , “ becoming vegan – express edition ” by brenda davis and vesanto melina . dr. greger has spoken highly of these authors and even had them as a guest blogger on this site . the book is excellent , extremely well researched , and includes some sample meal plans for varying levels of calorie needs . i consider it more of a reference book than a read-cover-to-cover book . so , it ’ s not a big investment in time to check out the book.2 ) 21 days of free meal plans – if you participate in the free pcrm ( physician ’ s committee for responsible medicine ) 21 day kickstart program , you will get 21 day ’ s worth of meal plans developed by top nutritionists . i believe that dr. greger has spoken support for this program and in addition to meal plans : they will hold your hand for 21 days , including recipes , videos , inspirational messages , and a forum where you can ask questions . the forum is monitored by a very respected rd. http : / / www.pcrm.org / kickstarthome / ( click the green “ register now ” button . ) 3 ) here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . it ’ s not quite the meal plans you are looking for , but it gives some great general advice that you will want to keep in mind , including b12 : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.i second thea ’ s recommendation of davis and melina . i have the expanded edition . it ’ s permanently on my nightstand and i refer to it all the time . everything in it is based on science , not on hunches or feelings . just the data in tables and charts are worth the price.i agree so much ! ! ! i got a great glimpse when dr. g. said he had yams / sweet potatoes with dried cranberries , etc . , sprinkled with cinnamon for breakfast one day . i tried something similar and had kabocha squash with frozen blueberries mixed in and sprinkled with cinnamon . it was delicious , and i never would have thought of it without having seen dr. g ’ s breakfast comment one day.i ´ m vegan for many years , but there is no improvement in my asthma . i need an inhaler for most of the year . seven servings of fruit and vegetables are a lot . i dont eat this every day . but i will try this in the next weeks . best regards from germany , rubenvitamin d3 , or rather the hormone like substance d3 , can treat and reduce the incidence of asthma attacks. http : / / www.webmd.com / asthma / news / 20100910 / vitamin-d-may-improve-asthma-control vitamin d3 is recommended on this site for all people . sunlight would probably be better . modern windows are uv opaque and probably let less d3 be made when people sit next to the them than ever before . i am interested in the d content of foods . i think cooking destroys it . plants use vitamin d and it may be present in fruits.my asthma resolved shortly after i eliminated all dairy products from my diet , around 25 years ago . i used to need to carry my inhaler with me at all times just in case i experienced a flare up . haven ’ t touched one in over two decades now and feel great ! should have made the move from veggie to vegan sooner … i ’ m confused about reaching 9-13 servings of fruits and vegetables , as the usda uses cups now instead . when you refer to a serving of fruit , is that the previously used usda serving size of about 1 / 2 cup for most and 1 cup for leafy greens ? or is each serving now 1 cup for most and 2 cups for leafy greens ? i find references to both measurements as a serving online . i don ’ t think i ’ m the only one confused ! : ) thank you so much ! allergies , alpha-carotene , animal products , antioxidants

PLAIN-7~how fruits and vegetables can prevent asthma asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and the prevalence is increasing around the world . despite this , most research dollars are spent on adult chronic disease . “ one might ask , ” a group of researchers posited “ whether this is because our politicians and senior administrators feel themselves to be more likely to suffer from the latter , and thus ignore allergic diseases as they mostly impact children and young adults ” – who don ’ t vote . an enormous study about asthma and allergies in childhood , highlighted in my video , preventing asthma with fruits and vegetables , was published that includes more than a million children in nearly a hundred countries , making it the most comprehensive survey of asthma and allergies ever undertaken . the researchers found striking worldwide variations in the prevalence and severity of asthma , allergies , and eczema — a 20 to 60-fold difference in prevalence of symptoms of asthma , allergic runny nose , and atopic eczema around the world . the large variability suggests a crucial role of local characteristics that are determining the differences in prevalence between one place and another . what kind of environmental factors ? why does the prevalence of itchy eyes and runny noses range anywhere from 1 % in india , for example , and up to 45 % of kids elsewhere ? there were some associations with regional air pollution and smoking rates , but the most significant associations were with diet . adolescents showed a consistent pattern of decreases in symptoms of wheeze ( current and severe ) , allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , and atopic eczema with increases in per capita consumption of plant foods . the more their calories and protein came from plant sources , the less allergies they tended to have . in general , there seems to be an association between an increase in asthma prevalence and a decrease in consumption of fresh fruits , green vegetables , and other dietary sources of antioxidants , helping to explain why the prevalence of asthma and respiratory symptoms is lower in populations with high intake of foods of plant origin . high intakes of fat and sodium , and low intakes of fiber and carbohydrates , are linked with asthma , while traditional and vegetarian diets are associated with lower rates . for example , if we look closer within india , in a study of more than 100,000 people , “ those who consumed meat ( daily or occasionally ) were more likely to report asthma than those who were strictly vegetarian . ” this also meant avoiding eggs . eggs have been associated ( along with soft drink consumption ) with increased risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma in schoolchildren . on the other hand , consumptions of soy foods and fruits were associated with reduced risk of respiratory symptoms . in fact , removing eggs and dairy from the diet may improve lung function in asthmatic children in as little as eight weeks . therefore , it may be a combination of eating fewer animal foods and more plants . high vegetable intake , for example , has been found protective in children , potentially cutting the odds of allergic asthma in half . and fruit has also shown a consistent protective association for current and severe wheeze and runny nose in adolescents , and for current and severe asthma , allergies , and eczema in children . why is this ? i ’ ve talked about the endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants ( see dietary sources of alkylphenol endocrine disruptors ) building up in the meat supply that may increase the risk of allergic disease , but the increase in asthma may be a combination of both a more toxic environment and a more susceptible population . one review notes that , “ the dietary changes which have occurred over recent years may have led to a reduction in these natural antioxidant defenses , resulting in a shift of the antioxidant status of the whole population and leading to increased susceptibility to oxidant attack and airway inflammation . ” in adults , for example , the risk of airway hyper-reactivity may increase seven-fold among those with the lowest intake of vitamin c from plant foods , while those with the lowest intake of saturated fats may have a 10-fold protection , presumably because of saturated fat ’ s role in triggering inflammation . the protective effect of plant-based food may also be mediated through effects on intestinal microflora . it turns out that differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood . kids with allergies , for example , tend to be less likely to harbor lactobacilli , the good bacteria that ’ s found in fermented foods , and naturally on many fruits and vegetables . lactobacillus probiotics may actually help with childhood asthma , which may help explain why children raised on largely organic vegetarian diets may have a lower prevalence of allergic reactions . infants raised this way tend to have more good lactobacilli in their guts compared to controls , though they were also more likely to have been born naturally , breastfed longer , and not been given antibiotics , so we can ’ t really tell if it ’ s the diet until we put it to the test ( see treating asthma with fruits and vegetables ) . more on preventing allergic diseases can be found in my videos preventing childhood allergies and preventing allergies in adulthood . more on protecting lung function with fruits and vegetables can be found in preventing copd with diet . surprised probiotics can affect immune function ? check out my video preventing the common cold with probiotics ? and if you think that is wild , wait until you see gut feelings : probiotics and mental health . what might be in plants that ’ s so beneficial ? see anti-inflammatory antioxidants . what might be in animal products that is harmful to lung function ? there are endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in the food chain that may be playing a role . see my video alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies . also there ’ s an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs that may contribute to inflammation as well . see inflammatory remarks about arachidonic acid . choosing fragrance-free personal care products may also help reduce airway reactivity : throw household products off the scent . i compare the efficacy of plants to pills ( treating asthma with plants vs. supplements ? ) and explore the role an entire diet filled with plants might play in treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets . wow ! ! all the more reason to eat loads of fruits and veggies ! ! but seeing this makes me wonder about that new study about citrus fruits . it doesn ’ t make sense that eating an orange or grapefruit each day could cause melanoma ! ! do you see this as an accurate study ? or , is it an example of “ more is not always better ” ? i have never heard of citrus causing melanoma . feel free to share any link or study that discusses this more . it seems like when it comes to fruits more is better ! yes , it was in the news yesterday . i think it might have some validity . consider that lemon and lime juice on top of the skin makes someone very photosensitive . maybe there are folks with leaky guts or some sort of indigestion / bad digestion of food ( or unhealthy macrobiome ) that allows ingested citrus to travel towards the skin , sweating it out , who knows . these science on this that came out really seems relevant and thorough , and has raised red flags.thanks ! citrus has been identified as a “ trigger ” for pain in patients with migraine headaches and arthritis , but to my knowledge this is very rare.guest , you may be on to something about leaky gut and citrus . 3 yrs ago i started drinking 1 / 2 a lemon in a glass of water . i have no history of ever being allergic to any food , even had the standard test done and nothing showed up . i guess it didn ’ t include lemon.anyways i ended up with hives all over my body . red bumps that also itched . after freaking out about that for a while i spent $ 100 to see a dermatologist and they prescribed me some prednisome . but before i took that it dawned on me to stop the lemon juice first , and very soon the hives left me . i guess as you get older something new might pop up . about the only citrus i eat now is maybe some orange on a salad.i haven ’ t heard or seen this , but if there is any validity at all , i am sure it is because of what gets done to it chemically in growth and processing , not the inherent fruit quality.maybe people who eat more citrus also live in warm climates where citrus is grown and get more sun exposure . could be a factor ! i usually eat one type or another of citrus each day , so i may need to stop ! thanks for such prompt replies ! ! ! i love the work that goes on here at nutrition facts ! ! ! ! ! well , if you are not experiencing any pain or discomfort i would suggest eating all the citrus you want ! just look at how healthful the stuff is ! here is a little ditty on citrus , if interested . thanks , lauraleah ! of course , ultimately it ’ s up to you to decided what ’ s best to eat . glad you are finding some helpful tips here at nutritionfacts . if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed.best , josephjust a thought to add here and that is consideration for people like me whose asthma is triggered by a salicylate sensitivity . i know i am not in the “ average ” group of those whose trigger is this , but i do know of at least two other persons in my area who have this too . we were all diagnosed with it by allergists . we must be careful how much fruit and veggies we eat and are equipped with our lists that tell us which fruit and veggies are “ very high ” , “ high ” etc for salicylate ( which is nature ’ s preservative of the fruit or vegetable ) . ps i just love your site and it is helping me and so many others cheers , anncitrus fruit and melanoma : is there any link ? grapefruit and melanoma : what ’ s happening here ? an association , yes . but is there a real risk ? thanks for the links ! also , as i often say on this blog , don ’ t forget that the total diet is important . i have checked out these references and find that the poor citrus has been taken out of context . as walt willet , md , of harvard says , “ food is a package deal . ” nearly all of the health professionals in the cited studies were carnivores . dr campbell comments on this in his excellent book , the china study . so , what we are really seeing in these studies is the possible effects of citrus within the context of a meaty diet . does that apply to you ? anyone seen any studies of the frugivore vegans – do they have a higher incidence of malignant melanoma ? or what about the low fat , whole food vegans ? it is my understanding that these last two groups are , in fact , widely known for their excellent skin quality and generally low cancer rates . wasn ’ t there a study a few years ago that attributed cancer in general to low fruit consumption ?

PLAIN-8~our tax dollars subsidize unhealthy foods why do food companies sell junk ? because unhealthy commodities are highly profitable . this is in part because of their “ low production cost , long shelf-life , and high retail value , ” which create perverse incentives for industries to market and sell more junk . in a study highlighted in my video , taxpayer subsidies for unhealthy foods , researchers at the university of cambridge stated , “ coca-cola ’ s net profit margins , for example , are about a quarter of the retail price , making soft drink production , alongside tobacco production , among the most profitable industrial activities in the world . ” one of the reasons production costs are so low is that we tax-payers subsidize them . distinguished unc professor of nutrition , barry popkin , writes : “ for more than a century , western governments have invested heavily in lowering the costs of animal products and some basic cash crops [ such as sugar ] . accordingly , western diets have shifted during the past century , especially after world war ii , to include more animal sourced foods — meat , poultry , dairy , seafood , and eggs [ as well as more sugar and corn syrup ] . during this same period , however , we have begun to realize that a healthy diet actually requires fewer animal products and empty calories , and more vegetables , fruits , beans , and whole grains . redressing this balance is a complex task requiring not only a shift in agricultural investment and policy , but also changes in social preferences that have developed over decades , in part due to dollar menu meat . ” why is chicken so cheap ? in the nine years that followed the passage of the ‘ 96 farm bill , corn and soy were subsidized below the cost of production to make cheap animal feed . so , u.s. tax-payers effectively handed the chicken and pork industry around $ 10 billion dollars each . what if we instead subsidized healthy foods ? or taxed harmful ones ? every dollar spent taxing processed foods or milk would net an estimated $ 2 in healthcare cost savings . every dollar spent making vegetables cheaper would net $ 3 , and subsidizing whole grains could net over a one thousand percent return on our investment . unfortunately , we can ’ t count on big broccoli . the produce sector lacks the extensive funding that went to create the national dairy council , the national cattlemen ’ s beef association , the national pork producers council , and the american egg board . even if we removed the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual subsidies for animal products , it might not be sufficient to tip the balance in favor of healthier diets . according to professor popkin , “ we have created societies in the west that value and consume meat , dairy , poultry , fish and seafood . over several generations , a particular way of life has been promoted that has shifted expectations about diet to include large amounts of animal-sourced foods ” — the concept that a meal centers around some hunk of meat . the idea that animal products should form the basis of our diet has been scientifically debunked , but remains the social aspiration of billions of people . as we in the west slowly come to accept that our diets and eating habits are not healthy , it is to be hoped that this will change policies not only here , but throughout the world . for more on the power big food ’ s hold over our political system , check out videos such as : my video series on corporate influence over our federal nutrition guidelines may also be enlightening : and if we really wanted to save our country money we could start by trying to wipe out some of our leading killer chronic diseases : what is that food product ? frozen yogurt stuff ? fake crab ? it ’ s a block of spam with uncle sam . note : you can always find the image credit at the bottom of the blog for more information about the picture.nf always has such great ( and artistic ) graphics , photos , and visual aids.many of the foreign students my daughter met in college were shocked by how inexpensive meat is in the us . they were from countries where meat is one of the most expensive foods … .which it really is in the us ( without subsidies ) as well.here ’ s a question from an earlier video : dr. greger reported on how piperine significantly ( up to 2000 % ! ) boosts the bioavailability of curcumin , but stopped short , it seemed to me , of recommending that one routinely combine black pepper and turmeric to have those effects . in an earlier talk by dr. greger for rouxbe cooking school , he seemed appalled at the proposition , but perhaps he has changed his point of view ? since the effects might be quite significant , i ’ d appreciate a clarification re the desirability of combining pepper with turmeric both for 1 ) those looking to prevent chronic metabolic diseases and for 2 ) those currently coping with such diseases . thanks ! cathy , piperine in black pepper increases the bioavailability of curcumin presumably by inhibiting an enzyme that participates in phase ii of the liver detoxification process . the problem is the same enzyme is responsible for the removal of some drugs and of some endogenous waste material . so , black pepper , while increasing there bioavailability of curcumin , increases the half life of some drugs , which is potentially dangerous . longer exposure to endogenous waste material may have negative effects as well . on the other hand , a lot of people eat black pepper with food regularly , apparently without any problems.thanks , george , for this clear explanation . i imagine anyone on medication that clears through the liver would be at risk if they boosted curcumin with piperine — a lot of people ! i use turmeric powder in a small dose of coconut oil to dissolve it and then i put it in a smoothie . i assume this is ok since i don ’ t use pepper ? dr. greger mentions that there are some people who should be careful about curcumin . please let me know if this helps answer your question.thanks joseph – so anyone taking medication which clears through the liver should be cautious ? if that ’ s so , perhaps dr. greger should express that qualifier , so people are advised before they jump on board the turmeric / pepper bandwagon . … .and the garlic bandwagon might also command a qualifier as john hopkins lupus center has advised that humans with autoimmune diseases / disorders should avoid garlic as well as ginseng , alfalfa , and some other stuff . ( john hopkins medical staff considered number one ( or two ) in the world ) . everything “ natural ” is not always in our best interest.poor underappreciated big broccoli . hey dr. greger , this ted talk reminded me of you : “ broccoli – the dna whisperer ” . https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hmfnzc3oz04you honestly believe if govt subsidized kale , we as americans would eat more kale ? count us in … kale and spinach salad is a family favorite , but hard to find spinach and kale fresh – they usually go bad within two days unless you can find them fresh , which is really rare even here in the middle of californiamaybe it is just wishful thinking on my part , but i feel a change is coming , though slowly ! people in general are waking up to the benefit of eating real food , at least more so than in the past , so hopefully the snowball will grow once it get ’ s rolling ! the internet has changed our interface with information gathering , which can be either negative or positive , depending on your good sense , or lack thereof , but the point is we can now find the info we need , if we know how and where to look ! it annoys me no end to see the bs that passes as fact for the sheeple who need to believe what they always have , so merely continue to buy into the subsidized agenda with no clue they are hopelessly brainwashed ! dr greger and others are the shining lights in this fog of noxious and dangerous “ spam ” ( above ) … ugh ! i clicked on the link for “ scientifically debunked ” in dr. greger ’ s post above and then skimmed part of the paper . i didn ’ t have time to read it in detail , but one sentence made me do a double-take , and then a triple take , and then a head scratch : “ rare was the scientist , such as weston price , whose studies of isolated indigenous populations prompted him to promote a vegetarian diet , or at least a diet with minimal meat , grown in natural environments ( price , 1981 ) . ​ ” wow . i wasn ’ t able to find the paper they were referencing to see more , but if this is an accurate representation of weston price ’ s work , that poor man must be raging from his grave to see what has been promoted in his memory . i * think * i remember plant positive talking about how weston price ’ s work has been twisted , but this is very interesting collaboration if true.you stumbled upon something amazing , thea . i followed the link too after reading your response , and found the same . they were actually not referencing a paper but price ’ s large book , nutrition and physical regeneration – the “ bible ” of the wapf . except it seems the organisation just cherry picks the thousands of case studies that it the “ high fat diet ” they promote . this books is a fascinating read , but just as that pub med article points out in such a startling way ( as you noticed ) price did not find that tribes who ate meat were big and strong and tribes that were vegetarian were weaklings . i ant aware he promoted a vegetarian diet at all ; i am not sure where that came from – but he certainly wasn ’ t a proponent of high meat and fat for all as the only way to be healthy . i see his actual focus more on “ no processed foods ” as the way to be healthy … which i think we ’ d all agree with . it ’ s also worth reminding ourselves that he was a dentist , focusing on oral health , and his ideas about nutrition and general heath were not founded on research as we see it today , but hypotheses . unfortunately , too many people saw them as facts . thanks for pointing out this amazing statement.mec : thanks for going the extra mile , looking into this , and then taking the time to report back . nice post.on the topic of the post , thank you dr. greger ! one of my pet peeves is how unhealthy foods like animal products are subsidized . i have long felt that if meat cost consumers what it actually costs the world ( including externalities – pollution , etc . ) , we would all be so healthy naturally . very few people would be able to afford meat regardless of their cultural biases . cultural biases would then ( probably / hopefully ? ) change over time … why can ’ t an organic vegetable council be formed and begin lobbying in washington d.c. ? lack of funding ? maybe . who wants to see an indiegogo funding project for “ big broccoli ” ? from news reports , i understand that organic produce is making huge profits in recent years . i think it ’ s time to start this veggie council.when folks at work learn that i eat plant based , they usually defend their consumption of animal products with a claim that they don ’ t feel satisfied / full unless they eat meat . how do i respond to that ? is it to do with gut microbiome ? i ’ ve heard that too . i think it ’ s because people don ’ t add enough starch to their meals . i ’ m not satisfied with a salad consisting of lettuce and chopped raw veggies , either . but when i add whole wheat pasta , brown rice , or a sweet potato , i feel more satisfied . i also like to add more protein and fat with beans , walnuts and various seeds . now we ’ re talking about a meal not an appetizer.like salads and fruit , pasta and rice leave me hungry – even if i literally eat more than my stomach should hold : every meal requires legumes , avocados , or nuts for me to feel full for more than 2 hours.phil c : i think that herb i. vore gave a great answer , but i also think it is only part of the answer . so , part of the problem is that people don ’ t know * how * to create a healthy meal that will satisfy them.another part , in my opinion , is psychological . since it is true , my answer to such a statement ( which i have heard several times before too ) often includes something along the lines of , “ i used to feel the same way . but as i started to eat more healthy , i realized that it was phychological . i was raised to think that i needed meat as part of the meal and that any dish without meat was the ‘ side ’ dish . so , of course i didn ’ t feel satisfied eating only a side dish . however , most people seem to find that when they start eating truly healthy whole foods , including plenty of good starches like beans and whole grains , and * enjoying * those foods and when they understand in their heads that such dishes are complete , then that feeling of satisfaction is there . ” i also think there is a third piece to this phenomenon that you touched on concerning gut stuff . have you seen this talk by michael klaper ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 0tjyb1wtxg4 anyway , this talk is speculation , but if it is true , then it may be that the person really does require some time to adjust to healthy eating . and you could explain that there is a possibility that they have harmed their bodies with the food they have eaten so far to the point where they are probably addicted to meat . they could wean themselves off of it if they wanted to … finally , the fourth piece is that there are some people who really aren ’ t interested in eating healthy and have never truly tried and are just saying what they * think * would happen if they gave it a try . ( because after eating the salad before the meal , they are still hungry . ) that situation requires a different response , but it would be hard to give such a response because if might come off as calling the person a liar.those are my thoughts . does that help ? american egg board , animal products , beans , chicken , coca cola , corn , corn syrup , cost savings , dairy eggs , empty calories , factory farming practices , farm bill , farmers , feed additives , fish , fruit , grains , industry influence , marketing , meat , medicare , milk , national cattlemen 's beef association , national dairy council , national pork producers council , pork , poultry , seafood , soda , soy , standard american diet , subsidies , sugar , tobacco , turkey , vegetables - -
PLAIN-9~reducing arsenic in chicken and rice in 2013 , maryland became the first state to ban the feeding of an arsenic-containing drug to chickens . this arsenic-containing drug is used to control parasites and gives chicken meat an “ appealing pink color . ” in 2011 , the fda found that the livers of chickens fed this drug had elevated levels of inorganic arsenic , a known human carcinogen . in response , the drug ’ s manufacturer , pfizer , voluntarily pulled the drug off the u.s. market . however , it ’ s still sold overseas — including to places that continue to export chicken back to us — and a similar arsenic-containing drug for use in poultry is still available in the united states . the maryland ban was still some help , though ; it kept maryland farmers from using stockpiles of the drug . how much arsenic gets into the actual meat and not just the internal organs ? we didn ’ t know until recently . in a study highlighted in my video , how many cancers caused by arsenic-laced chicken ? , researchers at the johns hopkins school of public health coordinated the purchase of chicken breasts off grocery store shelves in ten cities across the country . they found that 70 % of the samples of chicken meat from poultry producers that didn ’ t prohibit arsenic drugs were contaminated with the cancer-causing form of arsenic at levels that exceeded the safety thresholds originally set by the fda ( before the fda relented and admitted that there ’ s really no safe level of this kind of arsenic ) . when the drug was first approved , scientists believed that its organic arsenic base would be excreted unchanged ( organic arsenic is much less dangerous than inorganic arsenic ) . guess what appears to convert the drug into the carcinogenic form ? cooking . when chicken meat is cooked , levels of the arsenic-containing drug go down and levels of carcinogenic arsenic go up , suggesting the drug may degrade into the cancer-causing inorganic arsenic form during cooking . how much cancer are we talking about ? if we estimate that about three-quarters of americans eat chicken , then the arsenic in that chicken has potentially been causing more than 100 cases of cancer every year . the john hopkins researchers conclude that “ eliminating the use of arsenic-based drugs in [ poultry and pig ] production could reduce the burden of arsenic-related disease in the u.s. population . ” arsenic-containing drugs fed to chickens is one of the ways arsenic gets into rice . when we feed arsenic to chickens , the resulting arsenic-bearing poultry manure is introduced to the environment , soil , and water , and rice sucks it up from contaminated soil and can transfer it to people who don ’ t even eat chicken . there is massive environmental contamination from the poultry industry ; nearly two million pounds of arsenic has been poured into the environment every year by the u.s chicken industry alone . we ’ re even seeing arsenic in foods sweetened with organic brown rice syrup . it reminds me of the arsenic in apple juice story . although the u.s. made lead and arsenic-based pesticides illegal years ago , they still persist in the soil , so even organic products are not immune . there are other sources of arsenic ( such as naturally occurring arsenic deposits ) , but arsenic-containing poultry drugs have been deliberately administered to animals intended for human consumption for 70 years . consequently , exposures resulting from use of these drugs are far more controllable than are exposures from environmental sources . and the good news is that , thanks to a lawsuit from the center for food safety and other consumer groups , three out of the four arsenic-containing drugs fed to poultry have been officially pulled from the market . i ’ ve previously addressed this issue in my video arsenic in chicken . it ’ s nice to see there ’ s been some progress ! the antibiotics the poultry industry continues to feed chickens present another public health hazard . see my videos : cooking may also create other carcinogens from the muscle itself : “ and the good news is that , thanks to a lawsuit from the center for food safety and other consumer groups , three out of the four arsenic-containing drugs fed to poultry have been officially pulled from the market . ” is the remaining one drug still being fed to poultry nationwide ? is there any progress on banning the drugs internationally so they ’ re not poisoning the rest of the world and u.s. chicken eaters who are consuming imported chicken ? along similar lines , does anyone actually monitor the use of these banned substances , seeing as how they have stockpiles of them stashed away ? not really . if you ask an old cowboy named howard lyman he ’ ll tell you ranches stockpile illegal drugs and still use them today . when i interviewed him once he said not in 35 years had the usda ever came to his farm and asked questions.i am finding out . please sit tight ! seedy , thanks for your patience . dr. greger said “ the problem is that there are still stockpiles of the drug in use presumably but i think the one on the market is only sold for turkeys ” i also wrote a reply , here , ( just below ) about my interview with howard lyman back in 2008thanks so much for following up on this ! i ’ m not surprised by the answer . a sad state of affairs . and one of many reasons to avoid eating meat.i thought this was going to be an article on reducing arsenic in brown rice . wash thoroughly and cook using “ pasta ” method – several cups of water per cup of rice – pour off excess water after cooking.100 cases of cancer per hundreds of millions people per year doesn ’ t sound alarming compared to other threats.hey paul . that ’ s a great method for reducing arsenic in rice . thanks for sharing . it is important to note that the levels of arsenic in rice may not be as high when compared with other foods , and from the looks of it the main reason why our rice is contaminated with arsenic is due to poultry plants using it in the first place ! dr. greger has some great resources on food and arsenic . ​ he also compared arsenic levels of wild rice to brown rice in this ask the doctor q & a. ​ paul , i cook rice in a rice cooker . have you tried the “ pasta ” method using a rice cooker ? does it work ? how would you do that , exactly ? the convenience of the rice cooker is that you add the correct amount of water and the rice comes out nicely without excess water.what ’ s happening is that by providing extra cooking water one is hopefully leeching out more of the arsenic in that water ( and maybe nutrients : - ( its a pain , but what i sometimes do is strain the cooked rice and rinse in hot water ( if i want to be extra anal about it ) and put back in my pressure cooker in the “ warm ” mode to reheat and evaporate the remaining water . it really does take away from the convenience of a rice cooker or pressure cooker . damn poultry farms ! how about just soaking the rice overnight and discarding water ? thanks for continuing to bring to light ways we can better choose our food . without exposure , people are kept dumb , and that ’ s the way the food manufacturers want to keep it so you just blindly keep spending your money on what they offer . start your health path in a less toxic direction by getting the facts and share with your friends . it will make our world a better place to live.dr. greger : thank you for the article . i eat rice three meals a day almost everyday , so i ’ ve been concerned about arsenic in rice . is there a significant difference between white rice and brown rice with respect to the arsenic content ? a guest member supplied us with a link that looked at rice from different countries . i ’ ll post it , here . it is important to note that the levels of arsenic in rice may not be as high when compared with other foods . dr. greger has some great resources on food and arsenic . ​ he also compared arsenic levels of wild rice to brown rice in this ask the doctor q & a. ​ ​ i think it ’ s valuable to note when reports like these are published that perhaps many other foods containing arsenic were not tested ? i am not saying arsenic in rice is not concerning , but perhaps other foods also deserve awareness . the arsenic concentrates in the bran , so white rice would have less . i still do not think avoiding brown rice is necessary . in the report you can see what brands have the least . let me know if this helps ? thank you joseph and the guest so much for this article . i ’ d seen the original article in cr , but this is significantly revised and more detailed.thanks joseph and others here for the information and links . i have some reading to do . i ’ ve been wanting to switch my plant milk use to brown rice ( but hesitate due to the arsenic ) , from my current cashew milk – it ’ s so delicious , and so easy to make – but i want a similarly easy , healthful alternative that i can make , with less fat . anyone care to share their favorite , healthy , plant milk of choice ( grain or seed ) ? thank you ! ( btw : i ’ ve made quinoa “ milk ” – it ’ s good / easy to make too ) . maybe dr. greger has done a comparison on plant milks that i ’ ve missed . i ’ ll have to check that out too.you are welcome , tanya ! here are some links to videos on plant vs. cow ’ s calcium and and updated video on the same topic , here . here is one on almond milk vs. organic milk . the thought of making your own plant milks sounds amazing ! keep in mind it won ’ t have the vitamin and mineral core that is added to most plant-milks . however , you can certainly find those micronutrients elsewhere . i always suggest mixing it up a bit . i advocate for variety when it comes to foods like whole grains , beans , fruits , and veggies . the same could be said about plant-milks.thank you ! . good point on the lack of micronutrients in homemade plant-milks – i do try to get those elsewhere in my diet . yes , i agree , variety is key ! btw : here ’ s two simple rice / quinoa and cashew – milk recipes : http : / / www.absolutevegan.org / html / absolutevegan _ plantmilk _ recipe.html btw : as an ethical vegan , i need no convincing to avoid cow ’ s milk , a human health disaster , and the cause of unimaginable animal cruelty.oh gotcha . forgive me i was not trying to convince you ( or anyone ) to avoid cow ’ s milk . these videos are the only milk comparisons we have here so i thought i ’ d share . sorry if you had already seen . thanks for the recipe link i definitely need to try making my own ! oh – please , no apology needed ! the links are great – they offer ample science as to why we should all be avoiding milk & dairy in our diets … thanks again ! hey , i absolutely love oat milk , it ’ s super delicious and a bit sweeter than other plant milks . homemade hazelnut milk is also good but i don ’ t know how high the fat content would be in that one . i hardly ever drink oat milk though because of the packaging ( aluminum inside ) but you could always make it yourself : ) thanks dennis – i ’ ll find recipes and give both a try ! i ’ m sorry joseph , i meant to reply to tanya ! hey tanya , i accidentally replied to joseph ’ s comment instead of yours , you can find it below : ) watch your vitamin supplements , too . the industry often uses “ brown rice powder ” as a flow agent / capsule filler.garlic and other plants containing organosulfur compounds have been helpful in detoxifying arsenic . i know from personal experience . : - ) there may be a notion that organic brown rice has a lower arsenic level than conventional brown rice , but according to lundberg farms , their california-grown organic and conventional brown rice had the same level of inorganic arsenic present when tested . their test results are accessible via their website.yes. i contacted them and they told me just what you said.not much of a consolation for us currently , but very interesting all the same in regards to arsenic consumption : http : / / ehp.niehs.nih.gov / 121-a31 / apple juice , arsenic , brown rice syrup , cancer , carcinogens , center for food safety , chicken , cooking methods , fda , food additives , industrial toxins , johns hopkins university , lead , liver , meat , organic foods , parasites , persistent organic pollutants , pesticides , pork , poultry , rice , safety limits , turkey - -
PLAIN-10~how contaminated are our children ? in a study highlighted in my video , california childen are contaminated , researchers analyzed the diets of california children ages two through seven to determine the cancer and non-cancer health effects from food contaminant exposures . it turns out food may be the primary route of exposure to toxic heavy metals , persistent pollutants , and pesticides . “ though food-borne toxic contaminants are a concern for all ages , they are of greatest concern for children , who are disproportionately impacted because they ’ re still developing and have greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight . pediatric problems that have been linked to preventable environmental toxin exposures include cancer , asthma , lead poisoning , neurobehavioral disorders , learning and developmental disabilities , and birth defects . ” the good news is that changing one ’ s diet can change one ’ s exposure . quoting from the study , “ a diet high in fish and animal products , for example , results in greater exposure to persistent pollutants like ddt and dioxins and heavy metals than does a plant-based diet because these compounds bioaccumulate up the food chain . ” plants are at the bottom of the food chain . the sample of california kids , however , was not eating a plant-based diet . cancer benchmark levels were exceeded by all 364 children for arsenic , the banned pesticide dieldrin , a metabolite of ddt called dde , and dioxins . children exceeded safety levels by a greater margin than adults . this is especially of concern for children because all of these compounds are suspected endocrine disruptors and thus may impact normal development . cancer risk ratios were exceeded by over a factor of 100 for both arsenic and dioxins . which foods were the worst ? for preschoolers , the number one food source of arsenic was poultry , though for their parents , it was tuna . the number one source of lead was dairy , and for mercury it was seafood . and the number one source of the banned pesticides and dioxins was dairy . ( see preventing parkinson ’ s disease with diet . ) the researchers also recommended children should eat lower quantities of chips , cereal , crackers , and other crispy carbs to reduce acrylamide intake . the california study didn ’ t split up the groups by gender , but a similar study in europe found that men had higher levels of some of these pollutants than women . for example , levels of the banned pesticide chlordane were higher in men , but women who never breastfed were right up there alongside men , with the lowest levels found in women who breastfed over 12 months . therefore , it is likely that the lactation-related reduction in blood pollutant levels partly explains the lower body burdens among women compared with men . so cows can lower their levels by giving some to us , then we can pass it along to our children . what non-cancer effects might some of these pollutants have ? they can affect our immune system . studies clearly demonstrate the “ ability of dioxins and related compounds to have a long-lasting and deleterious impact on immune function . ” this manifests as increased incidences of respiratory infections , ear infections , cough , and sore throat . at first , most of the data was for during infancy , but now we have follow-up studies showing that the immunosuppressive effects of these toxins may persist into early childhood , so we should try to reduce our exposure as much as possible . because these pollutants accumulate in animal fat , consuming a plant-based diet – decreasing meat , dairy , and fish consumption – may reduce exposure for children and adults alike . these findings should come as no surprise to those who saw my video pollutants in california breast tissue . for an overview see cdc report on environmental chemical exposure and president ’ s cancer panel report on environmental risk . pollutant exposure may affect the ability to have children in the first place ( male fertility and diet and meat hormones & female infertility ) . such a delay , though , may allow one an opportunity to reduce one ’ s toxic burden through dietary change ( hair testing for mercury before considering pregnancy and how long to detox from fish before pregnancy ? ) . during pregnancy , pollutants can be transferred directly ( ddt in umbilical cord blood ) , and after pregnancy through breastfeeding ( the wrong way to detox ) . once our kids are contaminated , how fast can children detoxify from pcbs ? the chemicals have implications for older children too : protein , puberty , and pollutants . seafood is not the only source of toxic heavy metals . see : videos on primary food sources of other industrial pollutants include : there are some things we can eat , though , to counteract some of the toxins : ​ this blog reminds me of pcbs found in children ’ s fish oil and how algae-based omega 3 supplements may be much less risky.i may have missed it but has dr. gregor addressed the evils of vaccinations , a barbaric practice that directly injects contaminants into the infant or child ’ s bloodstream . it can ’ t get more directly poisoning than that.vaccination is one of the greatest public health triumphs in the history of humanity , not the lest of which for eliminating smallpox , which used to kill hundreds of millions of people.you ’ re just regurgitating what you ’ ve been taught but as one of my professors once said , “ what ’ s the use of knowing so much if what you know ain ’ t so ? ” so called smallpox is a body initiated and conducted process of elimination through the skin from excessive toxemia . as with any body elimination process , once this process has run it ’ s course , the patient always recovers . it ’ s the ones where there ’ s medical intervention , i.e. vaccines , etc. that die . the causes are cumulative emotional , physical and chemical stressors from dietary , environmental and lifestyle factors . “ doctor ” that is perhaps the most idiotic thing i ’ ve read in disqus.in the 60 ’ s millions a year worldwide died from smallpox . the world health org joined by dozens of other volunteer , charitable , health orgs and governments around the world launched a program to eradicate the disease . it took over a decade . the whole world , tv , newspapers , magazine media watched and documented a massive global vaccination program that encircled and extinguished outbreaks till in 1980 the disease was completely wiped off the planet.trying to rewrite that or deny that is like trying to deny that wwii happened . you sir are delusional. http : / / www.pbs.org / wgbh / aso / databank / entries / dm79sp.html http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 6293036 http : / / www.sciencemag.org / content / 196 / 4296 / 1298.short http : / / science.nationalgeographic.com / science / health-and-human-body / human-diseases / smallpox-article / https : / / web.stanford.edu / group / virus / pox / history.html # eradication http : / / ije.oxfordjournals.org / content / 1 / 1 / 25.abstractwait for it , there ’ s going to be some response about ddt ( or some other chemical ) or something like “ germs aren ’ t real , they are made up by big pharma to sell their products ” .no , bacteria are very real and they are also present when dis ease processes are made necessary but they are not causative . we have hundreds of billions of micro organisms in and on us . if they caused health complications , humans would not even exists.wrong , wrong wrong . there are pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms . some are symbiotic , some are parasitic . you live in a dreamland.wow , he comes from the land of friendly parasites and non-pathogenic microorganisms . i need to get some of what that dr is smokin ’ who knew if you just didn ’ t have any toxemia / contamination you could have avoided smallpox ? lol .. you have to be seriously dedicated to deluding yourself to keep that bs up . .. like a little kid with his fingers in his ears yelling “ nah-nah- nah-nah .. i can ’ t hear you ! ” .. “ germs aren ’ t real ! ! all scientists are wrong ! ! ! ” where do they come from ? i wish i knew . that thinking doesn ’ t really hold water though , considering the number of native americans that were killed by smallpox , they lived a pretty clean / natural lifestyle and it surely didn ’ t save them.http : / / scienceblogs.com / insolence / 2010 / 08 / 09 / yes-there-really-are-people-who-dont-acc / good read with insight into the denial , what their strawman premises of germ theory are .. and the idiot ’ s argument against it.micro organisms feed on waste matter and other toxic substances , not living tissue , number one . number two , do you honestly believe a simple celled organism is capable of overtaking a hundred trillion celled organism , the most sophisticated organism in existence with an army , navy , marines and swat team of defense mechanisms ? if you do , then you must also believe that the tine island country of grenada could invaded and take over the entire united states of america.well , it is patently obvious you have never taken a microbiology ( and probably not a biology class ) in your life . i don ’ t even know how to respond to that glob of crap.you obviously have been brainwashed to not understand how small micro organisms are mike.i ’ m breeding an army of them to take over the world , so if they are that small , how many do i need ? you ’ re right , i haven ’ t . if i did i would probably be as disinformed as you . instead i have undergone an extensive study of practical physiology . i skipped all the medically controlled “ education ” and went directly to useful practical information and my patients thank me for it all the time . if you ’ re extremely lucky , some day you too may find the right information but its doubltful.if only you could see me laughing at you right now.i did take biology in high school but that doesn ’ t really count.you ’ ve never acknowledged the smallpox question … are you in denial that the entire 12 year eradication vaccination campaign even happened ? ? ? i ’ m not in denial about any of this . what i am is correctly educated as to what dis ease is , what purpose these physiological processes serve and what makes them necessary . and also that there ’ s no such thing as vaccine . it ’ s just a concept like the moon is made out of cheese is a concept but obviously it has on validity , neither does so called vaccine . the human body can only use a limited number of substances and the ingredients in so called vaccines , ( embalming fluid , razor sharp micro slivers of aluminum , msg , polysorbate 80 , mercury derivatives , macerated putrefied monkey kidneys , etc . ) , are definitely not on the list . they belong in the witch ’ s cauldron straight out of “ macbeth ” . if you don ’ t think such a caustic chemical soup injected directly into the body – no chance to be partially neutralized by the digestive system – damages healthy cells and cellular function or even can kill the entire organism , you ’ re certifiably imbecilic . perhaps you should make your own “ cocktail ” of the above “ vaccine ” ingredients and down a glass full and see how that works for you . it will probably make your completely immune to everything for eternity as i ’ ve seen other morons do who were medically tricked by “ experts ” like yourself into believing they caught something and took “ medicine ” and it cured them alright … they all died ! again i ask are you denying the eradication of smallpox took place ? there it is … something even more laughably ignorant than your other post .. doctor … what a joke.there it is … a post more laughably ignorant than your first post … doctor … what a joke.and you dodged the question.blah blah blah … i ’ m sure your imaginary patients feel extremely lucky they found you . do they give you a link to a colorful printable diploma once you ’ ve “ passed ” that extensive study ? troll … delusional faker.nope , i ’ m correct . you have been medically brainwashed but you wouldn ’ t know that because if you knew you were brainwashed you wouldn ’ t be brainwashed but you are – irreversibly brainwashed . you ’ ve only studied wrong information that is promulgated by medical interests which definitely include cdc , who , nih , etcetera so that they can “ save the day ” with their lab synthesized chemicals and make billions . medicine ’ s top priority is to make sure the public never suspects that the on going complications people experience are from their underlying illness and not from the “ medicines ” but that ’ s slowly changing as more and more people wake up to the delusion of so called medicine . you haven ’ t found the correct information yet , keep searching . as always , health is only produced by healthful living and not from drugging people , duh … and the 12 year vaccination campaign that the entire world witnessed as the scourge was eradicated at the cost of millions to the governments and entities .. that provided the doctors and nurses and aide workers and vaccines ( manufactured and contributed by the russians mostly ) .. that went at their own peril into disease ridden 3rd world hot spots .. the millions that died .. that was all what ? a dream .. an elaborate hoax ? it happened .. the whole world watched and participated .. it ’ s not a matter of being misinformed moron . you are in some kind of deep grand delusion if you think you can spin smallpox away with germ theory denialist bs . duh … dr. greger , i believe it is very important that you do a video segment on “ the vegan diet ” which you talk about so much . people need to know many things all at once , in one video : such as how there are many canned foods that are extremely high in salt ; soluble and insoluble fats , vitamins , and fibers ; electrolytes ( especially important for developing teens who get dead arms while sleeping / sitting ) ; steamed vs raw for absorption ; probably juicing too ; celtic sea salt ( for electrolytes ) ; and i could probably think of a few other things too but there are things new vegans need to know before they switch or there could be serious problems that arise … it needs to be done.thanks doc . love the info and the vids.hey robert . i appreciate the suggestion . we do not promote a particular “ diet ” so a video on vegan diets would not be appropriate . i can send you loads of resources to organizations who promote vegan diets and have menu plans and recipe options . for those following a vegan diet or looking to transition i love dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations . of course , as you point out , he covers many research studies conducted on vegan diets or populations who follow a vegetarian or even a more plant-based type of diet . i am happy to help answer any questions you have about a healthful vegan diet . maybe i can write a post about what consists of a healthful vegan diet ? if that is something our site visitors would like i ’ ll ask dr. greger if i can post something in my ask the dietitian section under “ nutrition questions ” thanks again for your thoughts , josephthis is a great blog post . thanks for writing it . i often read the abstracts you refer to . i read the california one and the abstract also implicated vegetables and fruit with heavy metal contamination , right up there with dairy . i am assuming the actual article ( not the abstract ) went into more detail and showed tuna , poultry and the other animal foods you mention are higher risk factors . or was it more a leap of faith / understanding that the higher up the food chain you go , the worse it gets ? i just want to be certain i ’ m passing on reliable information to people , and not just reading with a ‘ vegan is best ’ slant.hi mec . thanks for utilizing the abstracts . i wouldn ’ t assume anything ! it ’ s always great to double check to make sure dr. greger and myself are reporting the study findings correctly . we are pretty quick to fix any errors , so please , if you ever see anything “ off ” just ask . are you referring to fig . 3 in that study ? you are right it seems that the selected fruits and vegetables mentioned in the abstract contributed to pesticide exposure . the good news is that finding organic options essentially eliminates this concern . plus , eating organic may be healthier and safer . let me know if this helps . thanks again for your comments.thanks for your fast reply . i was able to read the whole article ( linked to the video referred to in this article ) and it did make it clear that the more animal foods we eat , the more contamination . that ’ s what the actual researchers said . then in the breakdown they pointed out repeatedly the fact that various plant foods also added to the heavy metal risk . i have always found dr gregor ’ s articles and videos reliable information , and am glad to say this has also proven to be the case.i think as vegans , it becomes a habit of ‘ putting down ’ animal foods , but forgetting to mention that we need to aim for nutritional excellence in plant foods also . in fact , even though i had read often about heterocyclic amines in cooked meat , i had heard nothing about acrylamides until this week when i both studied it in my nutrition degree as well as read this article on dr gregor ’ s website . vegans are always baking vegetables , grilling vegetables , stir-frying vegetables in water till they ‘ caramelise ’ ( or should i say ‘ acrylamidise ’ ) , baking vegan type cakes and cookies – and no one says a thing about the carcinogens caused by these cooking methods . maybe this is why vegans also get cancer , despite meat avoidance . it might be time to bring this to light , for the good of the whole vegan community.joseph , do you know if it ’ s true or not that lacto fermenting veggies can break down pesticides and certain pollutants , as i ’ ve read in many separate places that say also it reduces the need to buy everything organic , which i just can ’ t afford to do , ( so am progressively growing more of my own . ) not everyone provides the studies like you do here ! if only ! thanks ! hi charzie . i ’ m not familiar with any research . if you find any links post them ! i think organics are preferred , but please don ’ t let that stop you from eating whole foods ! often finances keep us from buying the most healthful items in the market , but we still have to eat . the benefits of eating conventional veggies outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure . i agree that if you have the space growing your own is preferred.hey charzie , organic is an expensive premium product like fancy cigars and expensive brandy , so save your money and eat more conventional fruits and veggies , you will be far more healthy in the long run and you might even have a bit of extra coin in your pocket to treat yourself to some fancy chocolate or a night out . best wishesmercola says lacto fermenting works , so it surely must.what the hell is lacto fermenting ? will it make my pizza taste better ? think kimchi and sauerkraut . i don ’ t think those things would make pizza better , rather the opposite.canadian bacon and sauerkraut pizza . sounds gross , but it ’ s delicious.i ’ m going with gross on that one , mostly because i find sauerkraut repulsive.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?
